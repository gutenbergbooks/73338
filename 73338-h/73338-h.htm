  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='c009'>THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOLOGY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Biology (Greek, <i>bios</i>, life; <i>logos</i>, discourse) means the
science of life. It treats of animals and plants. That
branch of biology which treats of animals is called <i>zoology</i>
(Gr. <i>zoon</i>, animal; <i>logos</i>, discourse). The biological
science of <i>botany</i> (Gr. <i>botane</i>, plant or herb) treats of
plants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Living things are distinguished from the not living by a
series of processes, or changes (feeding, growth, development,
multiplication, etc.), which together constitute what
is called life. These processes are called <i>functions</i>. Both
plants and animals have certain parts called <i>organs</i> which
have each a definite work, or function; hence animals and
plants are said to be organized. For example, men and
most other animals have a certain organ (the mouth) for
taking in nourishment; another (the food tube), for its
digestion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Because of its <i>organization</i>, each animal or plant is said
to be an <i>organism</i>. Living things constitute the <i>organic
kingdom</i>. Things without life and not formed by life
constitute the <i>inorganic</i>, or <i>mineral</i>, <i>kingdom</i>. Mark I for
inorganic and O for organic after the proper words in this
list: granite, sugar, lumber, gold, shellac, sand, coal, paper,
glass, starch, copper, gelatine, cloth, air, potatoes, alcohol,
oil, clay. Which of these things are used for food by
animals? Conclusion?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><b>Energy in the Organic World.</b>—We see animals exerting
energy; that is, we see them moving about and doing
work. Plants are never seen acting that way; yet they
need energy in order to form their tissues, grow, and raise
themselves in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Source of Plant Energy.</b>—We notice that green plants
thrive only in the light, while animal growth is largely independent
of light. In fact, in the salt mines of Poland
there are churches and villages below the ground, and
children are born, become adults, and live all their lives
below ground, without seeing the sun. (That these people
are not very strong is doubtless due more to want of fresh
air and other causes than to want of sunlight.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>The need of plants for
sunlight shows that they
must obtain something
from the sun.</i> This has
been found to be <i>energy</i>.
This enables them to <i>lift</i>
their <i>stems</i> in growth, and <i>form</i> the various structures
called <i>tissues</i> which make up their stems and leaves.
It is noticed that they take in
food and water from the soil
through their roots. Experiments
also show that green plants take
in through pores (Fig. <a href='#fig_001'>1</a>), on the
surface of their leaves, a gas
composed of carbon and oxygen,
and called <i>carbon dioxide</i>. The
<i>energy in the sunlight</i> enables the
plant <i>to separate out the carbon,
of the carbon dioxide</i> and to build
mineral and water and carbon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>into organic substances. The oxygen of the carbon dioxide
is set free and returns to the air (Fig. <a href='#fig_002'>2</a>). Starch, sugar,
oil, and woody fibre are examples of substances thus
formed. Can you think of any fuel not due to plants?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>How Animals obtain Energy.</b>—You have noticed that
starch, oil, etc., will <i>burn</i>, or <i>oxidize</i>, that is, <i>unite with the
oxygen of the air</i>; thus the sun’s energy, stored in these
substances, is changed back to heat and motion. The
oxidation of oil or sugar may occur in a furnace; it may
also occur in the living substance of the active animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for the animals, the plants oxidize very little
of the substances built up by them, since they do not move
about nor need to keep themselves warm. We notice that
animals are constantly using plant substances for food, and
constantly drawing the air into their bodies. If the sunlight
had not enabled the green plant to store up these
substances and to set free the oxygen (Fig. <a href='#fig_003'>3</a>), animals
would have no food to eat nor air to breathe; hence we
may say that the sunlight is indirectly the source of the
life and energy of animals. Mushrooms and other plants
without green matter cannot set oxygen free (Fig. <a href='#fig_003'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span><b>Experiment to show the Cause of Burning, or Oxidation.</b>—Obtain
a large glass bottle (a pickle jar), a short candle,
and some matches. Light the candle and put it on a table
near the edge, and cover it with the glass jar. The flame
slowly smothers and goes out. Why is this? Is the air
now in the jar different from that which was in it before
the candle was lighted? Some change must have taken
place or the candle would continue to burn. To try
whether the candle will burn again under the jar without
changing the air, slide the jar to the edge of the table and
let the candle drop out. Light the candle and slip it up
into the jar again, the jar being held with its mouth a little
over the edge of the table to receive the candle (Fig. <a href='#fig_005'>5</a>).
The flame goes out at once. Evidently the air in the jar
is not the same as the air outside. Take up the jar and
wave it to and fro a few times, so as to remove the old air
and admit fresh air. The candle now burns in it with as
bright a flame as at first. So we conclude that the candle
will not continue to burn unless there is a constant supply
of fresh air. The gas formed by the burning is carbon
dioxide. It is the gas from which plants extract carbon.
(Beginners’ Botany, Chap. XIII.) One test for the presence
of this gas is that it forms a white, chalky cloud in lime
water; another is that it smothers a fire.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Experiment to show that Animals give off Carbon Dioxide.</b>—Place
a cardboard over the mouth of a bottle containing
pure air. Take a long straw, the hollow stem of a weed,
a glass tube, or a sheet of stiff paper rolled into a tube,
and pass the tube into the bottle through a hole in the
cardboard. Without drawing in a deep breath, send one
long breath into the bottle through the tube, emptying the
lungs by the breath as nearly as possible (Fig. <a href='#fig_004'>4</a>). Next,
invert the bottle on the table as in the former experiment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>afterward withdrawing the cardboard. Move the bottle
to the edge of the table and pass the lighted candle up
into it (Fig. <a href='#fig_005'>5</a>). Does the flame go out as quickly as
in the former experiment?</p>

<p class='c011'>If you breathe through a tube into clear lime water,
the water turns milky. The effect of the breath on the
candle and on the lime water shows that carbon dioxide is
continually leaving our bodies in the breath.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Oxidation and Deoxidation.</b>—The union of oxygen with
carbon and other substances, which occurs in fires and
in the bodies of animals, is called <i>oxidation</i>. The separation
of the oxygen from carbon such as occurs in the
leaves of plants is called <i>deoxidation</i>. <i>The first process
sets energy free, the other process stores it up.</i> Animals
give off carbon dioxide from their lungs or gills, and plants
give off oxygen from their leaves. But plants need some
energy in growing, so oxidation also occurs in plants, but
to a far less extent than in animals. At night, because
of the absence of sunlight, no deoxidation is taking place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in the plant, but oxidation and growth continue; <i>so at
night the plant actually breathes out some carbon dioxide</i>.
The deepest part of the lungs contains the most carbon
dioxide. Why was it necessary to empty the lungs as
nearly as possible in the experiment with the candle? Why
would first drawing a deep breath interfere with the experiment?
Why does closing the draught of a stove, thus
shutting off part of the air, lessen the burning? Why does
a “firefly” shine brighter at each breath? Why is the pulse
and breathing faster in a fever? Very slow in a trance?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The key for understanding any animal</b> is to find <i>how
it gets food and oxygen</i>, and how it uses the energy
thus obtained to grow, move, avoid its enemies, and get
more food. Because it moves, it needs senses to guide it.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The key for understanding a plant</b> is to find <i>how it gets
food and sunlight</i> for its growth. It makes little provision
against enemies; its food is in reach, so it needs no senses
to guide it. The plant is built on the plan of having the
nutritive activities <i>near the surface</i> (<i>e.g.</i> absorption by roots;
gas exchange in leaves). The animal is built on the plan
of having its nutritive activities <i>on the inside</i> (<i>e.g.</i> digestion;
breathing).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Cell and Protoplasm.</b>—Both plants and animals are
composed of small parts called <i>cells</i>. Cells are usually
microscopic in size. They have various shapes, as spherical,
flat, cylindrical, fibre-like, star-shaped. The living
substance of cells is called <i>protoplasm</i>. It is a stiff, gluey
fluid, <i>albuminous</i> in its nature. Every cell has a denser
spot or kernel called a <i>nucleus</i>, and in the nucleus is a still
smaller speck called a <i>nucleolus</i>. Most cells are denser and
tougher on the outside, and are said to have a <i>cell wall</i>,
but many cells are naked, or without a wall. Hence the
indispensable part of a cell is not the wall but the nucleus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and a <i>cell may be defined as a bit of protoplasm containing
a nucleus</i>. This definition includes naked cells as well as
cells with walls.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>One-celled Animals.</b>—There are countless millions of
animals and plants the existence of which was not suspected
until the invention of the microscope
several centuries ago. They are
one-celled, and hence microscopic in size.
It is believed that the large animals and
plants are descended from one-celled animals
and plants. In fact, each individual
plant or animal begins life as a single
cell, called an egg cell, and forms its
organs by the subdivision of the egg cell into many cells.
An egg cell is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_006'>6</a>, and the first stages in the
development of an egg cell are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_007'>7</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The animals to be studied in the first chapter are <i>one-celled
animals</i>. To understand them we must learn how
they eat, breathe, feel, and move. They are called <i>Protozoans</i>
(Greek <i>protos</i>, first, and <i>zoon</i>). All other animals
are composed of many cells and are called <i>Metazoans</i>
(Greek <i>meta</i>, beyond or after). The cells composing the
mucous membrane in man are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_008'>8</a>. The cellular
structure of the leaf of a many-celled plant is illustrated
in Fig. <a href='#fig_001'>1</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><b>Method of Classifying Animals.</b>—The various animals
display differences more or less marked. The question
arises, are not some of them more closely related than
others? We conclude that they are, since the difference
between some animals is very slight, while the
difference between others is quite marked.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To show <i>the different steps in classifying</i>
an animal, we will take an example,—the
cow. Even little children
learn to recognize a cow, although individual
cows differ somewhat in form,
size, colour, etc. The varieties of cows,
such as short-horn, Jersey, etc., all
form one <i>species</i> of animals, having the
scientific name <i>taurus</i>. Let us include
in a larger group the animals closest
akin to a cow. We see a cat, a bison,
and a dog; rejecting the cat and the
dog, we see that the bison has horns,
hoofs, and other similarities. We include
it with the cow in a <i>genus</i> called
<i>Bos</i>, calling the cow Bos taurus, and
the bison, Bos bison. The sacred cow
of India (Bos indicus) is so like the
cow and the buffalo as also to belong to the genus Bos.
Why is not the camel, which, like Bos bison, has a hump,
placed in the genus Bos?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Old World buffaloes,—most abundant in Africa
and India,—the antelopes, sheep, goats, and several other
genera are placed with the genus Bos in a <i>family</i> called
the <i>hollow-horned animals</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>This family, because of its even number of toes and
the habit of chewing the cud, resembles the camel family,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the deer family, and several other families. These are all
placed together in the next higher systematic unit called
an <i>order</i>, in this case, the order of <i>ruminants</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ruminants, because they are covered with hair
and nourish the young with milk, are in every essential
respect related to the one-toed horses, the beasts of
prey, the apes, etc. Hence they are all placed in a
more inclusive division of animals, the <i>class</i> called
<i>mammals</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>All mammals have the skeleton, or support of the
body, on the inside, the axis of which is called the vertebral
column. This feature also belongs to the classes
of reptiles, amphibians, and fishes. It is therefore
consistent to unite these classes by a general idea or
conception into a great <i>branch</i> of animals called the
<i>vertebrates</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning from the general to the particular by successive
steps, state the branch, class, order, family, genus,
and species to which the cow belongs.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Eight Branches or Sub-kingdoms.</b>—The simplest
classification divides the whole animal kingdom into
eight branches, named and characterized as follows, beginning
with the lowest: I. <span class='sc'>Protozoans.</span> One-celled.
II. <span class='sc'>Sponges.</span> Many openings. III. <span class='sc'>Polyps.</span> Circular;
cuplike; having only one opening which is both mouth and
vent. IV. <span class='sc'>Echinoderms.</span> Circular; rough-skinned; two
openings. V. <span class='sc'>Molluscs.</span> No skeleton; usually with external
shell. VI. <span class='sc'>Vermes.</span> Elongate body, no jointed legs.
VII. <span class='sc'>Arthropods.</span> External jointed skeleton; jointed
legs. VIII. <span class='sc'>Vertebrates.</span> Internal jointed skeleton with
axis or backbone.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This is the briefest classification. Animals have also been divided into twelve
branches. The naming of animals is somewhat chaotic at present, but an attempt
to come to an agreement is now being made by zoologists of all nations.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—Amœbas live in the slime found on submerged
stems and leaves in standing water, or in the ooze at the bottom.
Water plants may be crowded into a glass dish and allowed to
decay, and after about two weeks the amœba may be found in
the brown slime scraped from the plants. An amœba culture
sometimes lasts only three days. The most abundant supply
ever used by the writer was from a bottle of water where some
oats were germinating. Use ⅕ or ⅙ inch objective, and cover
with a thin cover glass. Teachers who object to the use of
the compound microscope in a first course should require a
most careful study of the figures.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Form and Structure.</b>—The amœba looks so much like
a clear drop of jelly that a
beginner cannot be certain
that he has found one until
it moves. It is a speck of
protoplasm (Fig. <a href='#fig_009'>9</a>), with a
clear outer layer, the <i>ectoplasm</i>;
and a granular, internal
part, the <i>endoplasm</i>.
Is there a distinct line between
them? (Fig. <a href='#fig_010'>10</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Note the central portion
and the slender prolongations
or <i>pseudopods</i> (Greek,
false feet). Does the endoplasm extend into the pseudopods?
(Fig. <a href='#fig_010'>10</a>.) Are the pseudopods arranged with any
regularity?</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes it is possible to see a denser appearing portion,
called the <i>nucleus</i>; also a clear space, the <i>contractile
vacuole</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_010'>10</a>).</p>

<div id='fig_011'  class='figleft id011'>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 11.</span>—The same amœba seen at different times.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Movements.</b>—Sometimes while the pseudopods are being
extended and contracted, the central portion remains
in the same place (this is <i>motion</i>).
Usually only one pseudopod
is extended, and the body
flows into it; this is <i>locomotion</i>
(Fig. <a href='#fig_011'>11</a>). There is a new foot
made for each step.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Feeding.</b>—If the amœba crawls near a food particle, the
<i>pseudopod is pressed against it</i>, or a depression occurs (Fig.
<a href='#fig_012'>12</a>), and the particle is soon embedded in the endoplasm.
Often a clear space called a <i>food vacuole</i> is noticed around
the food particle. This is the water that is taken in with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the particle (Fig. <a href='#fig_012'>12</a>). The water and the
particle are soon absorbed and assimilated
by the endoplasm.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 12.—The Amœba</span> taking food.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Excretion.</b>—If a particle of sand or other
indigestible matter is taken in, <i>it is left behind</i>
as the amœba moves on. There is a clear
space called the <i>contractile vacuole</i>, which
slowly contracts and disappears, then reappears
and expands (Figs. <a href='#fig_009'>9</a> and <a href='#fig_010'>10</a>). This
possibly aids in excreting oxidized or useless
material.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Circulation</b> in the amœba consists of the
movement of its protoplasmic particles. It
lacks special organs of circulation.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Feeling.</b>—<i>Jarring</i> the glass slide seems to
be felt, for it causes the activity of the amœba
to vary. It does not take in for food every
particle that it touches. This may be the
beginning of <i>taste, based upon mere chemical
affinity</i>. The pseudopods aid in feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—Sometimes an amœba is
seen dividing into two parts. A <i>narrowing</i>
takes place in the middle; the <i>nucleus also
divides</i>, a part going to each portion (Fig. <a href='#fig_013'>13</a>).
The mother amœba finally divides into two daughter
amœbas. Sex is wanting.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 13.—Amœba</span>, Dividing.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Source of the Amœba’s Energy.</b>—We thus see that the
amœba moves without feet, eats without a mouth, digests
without a stomach, feels
without nerves, and, it
should also be stated,
breathes without lungs,
for <i>oxygen is absorbed</i>
from the water <i>by its whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>surface</i>. Its <i>movements require energy</i>; this, as in all animals,
is furnished by the <i>uniting of oxygen with the food</i>.
Carbon dioxide and other waste products are formed
by the union; these pass off at the surface of the amœba and
taint the water with impurities.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Questions.</b>—Why will the amœba die in a very small quantity of
water, even though the water contains enough food? Why will it die
still quicker if air is excluded from contact with the drop of water?</p>

<p class='c017'>The amœba never dies of old age. Can it be said to be immortal?</p>

<p class='c017'>According to the definition of a cell (<i>Chapter I</i>), is the amœba a
unicellular or multicellular animal?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Cysts.</b>—If the water inhabited by a protozoan dries up,
it encysts, that is, it forms a tough skin called a cyst.
Upon return of better conditions it breaks the cyst and
comes out. Encysted protozoans may be blown through
the air: this explains their appearance in vessels of water
containing suitable food but previously free from protozoans.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>The Slipper Animalcule or Paramecium</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—Stagnant water often contains the paramecium as
well as the amœba; or they may be found in a dish of water containing
hay or finely cut clover, after the dish has been allowed to
stand in the sun for several days. A white film forming on the
surface is a sign of their presence. They may even be seen with
the unaided eye as tiny white particles by looking through the side
of the dish or jar. Use at first a ⅓ or ¼ in. objective. Restrict
their movements by placing cotton fibres beneath the cover glass;
then examine with ⅕ or ⅙ objective. Otherwise, study figures.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Shape and Structure.</b>—The paramecium’s whole body,
like the amœba’s, is only one cell. It resembles a slipper
in <i>shape</i>, but the pointed end is the hind end, the <i>front end</i>
being rounded (Fig. <a href='#fig_014'>14</a>). The paramecium is propelled
by the rapid beating of numerous fine, threadlike appendages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>on its surface, called <i>cilia</i> (Latin, eyelashes) (Figs.).
The cilia, like the pseudopods of the amœba, are merely
prolongations of the cell protoplasm,
but they are permanent. The separation
between the outer <i>ectoplasm</i>
and the interior granular <i>endoplasm</i>
is more marked than in the amœba
(Fig. <a href='#fig_014'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Nucleus and Vacuoles.</b>—There is
a large nucleus called the macronucleus,
and beside it a
smaller one called the
micronucleus. They are
hard to see. About one
third of the way from
each end is a clear, pulsating
space (bb. Fig.
<a href='#fig_015'>15</a>) called the pulsating
vacuole. These
spaces contract until
they disappear, and then
reappear, gradually expanding.
Tubes lead from the vacuoles which probably
serve to keep the contents of the cell in circulation.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Feeding.</b>—A depression, or <i>groove</i>, is seen on one side;
this serves as a mouth (Figs.). A <i>tube</i> which serves as a
gullet leads from the
mouth-groove to the interior
of the cell. The
mouth-groove is lined
with cilia which sweep
food particles inward.
The particles accumulate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>in a mass at the inner end of the gullet, become separated
from it as a <i>food ball</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_014'>14</a>), and sink into the soft protoplasm
of the body. The food balls
follow a circular course through the
endoplasm, keeping near the ectoplasm.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—This, as in the amœba,
is by division, the constriction being in
the middle, and part of the nucleus going
to each half. Sometimes two individuals
come together with their
mouth-grooves touching and
exchange parts of their nuclei
(Fig. <a href='#fig_016'>16</a>). They then separate

<p><span class='sc'>Fig 29.</span>—Skeleton of a glass sponge.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sponges are divided into <i>three classes</i>,
according as their skeletons are flinty
(silicious), limy (calcareous), or horny.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the <i>silicious sponges</i> have
skeletons that resemble spun glass in
their delicacy. Flint is chemically nearly
the same as glass. The skeleton shown
in Fig. <a href='#fig_029'>29</a> is that of a glass sponge which
lives near the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>horny sponges</i> do not have spicules
in their skeletons, as the flinty and
limy sponges have, but the skeleton
is composed of interweaving fibres of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><i>spongin</i>, a durable substance of the same chemical nature as silk
(Figs. <a href='#fig_030'>30</a> and <a href='#fig_031'>31</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>limy sponges</i> have skeletons made of numerous spicules of
lime. The three-rayed spicule is the commonest form.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 31.</span>—Section of horny sponge.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The commercial sponge, seen <i>as it grows in the ocean</i>, appears
as a roundish mass with a smooth, dark exterior, and having about
the consistency of beef liver. Several large openings (oscula),
from which the water flows, are visible on the upper surface.
Smaller holes (inhalent pores—many of them so small as to be
indistinguishable) are on the sides. If the sponge is disturbed,
the smaller holes, and
perhaps the larger
ones, will close.</p>

<p class='c011'>The outer layer of
cells serves as a sort
of skin. Since so
much of the sponge
is in contact with
water, most of the
cells do their own
breathing, or absorption
of oxygen and giving off of carbon dioxide. <i>Nutriment</i> is
passed on from the surface cells to nourish the rest of the body.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—Egg cells and sperm-cells are produced by
certain cells along the canals. The egg cell, after it is fertilized
by the sperm cell, begins to divide and form new cells, some of
which possess cilia. The embryo sponge passes out at an osculum.
By the vibration of the cilia, it swims about for a while.
It afterwards settles down with the one end attached to the ocean
floor and remains fixed for the rest of its life. The other end develops
oscula. Some of the cilia continue to vibrate and create
currents which bring food and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>cilia</i> in many species are found only in cavities called
ciliated chambers. (Figs. <a href='#fig_022'>22</a>, <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>.) There are no <i>distinct organs</i>
in the sponge and there is very little <i>specialization</i> of cells. The
ciliated cells and the reproductive cells are the only specialized
cells. The sponges were for a long time considered as colonies
of separate one-celled animals classed as protozoans. They are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>without doubt, many-celled animals.  If a living sponge is cut
into pieces, each piece will grow and form a complete sponge.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>That the sponge is not a colony of one-celled animals</b>, each like
an amœba, but is a many-celled animal, will be realized by examining
Fig. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>, which shows a bit of sponge highly magnified. A
sponge may be conceived as having developed from a one-celled
animal as follows: Several
one-celled animals
happened to live side by
side; each possessed a
threadlike flagellum (E,
Fig. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>) or whip-lash for
striking the water. By
lashing the water, they
caused a stronger current
(Fig. <a href='#fig_025'>25</a>) than protozoans
living singly
could cause. Thus they
obtained more food and
multiplied more rapidly
than those living alone.
The habit of working
together left its impress
on the cells and was transmitted
by inheritance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cell joined to cell
formed a ring; ring
joined to ring formed a tube which was still more effective than
a ring in lashing the water into a current and bringing fresh food
(particles of dead plants and animals) and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Few animals eat sponges</b>; possibly because spicules, or fibres,
are found throughout the flesh, or because the taste and the odour are
unpleasant enough to protect them. Small animals sometimes
crawl into sponges to hide. One sponge grows upon shells inhabited
by hermit crabs. Moving of the shell from place to place
is an advantage to the sponge, while the sponge conceals and thus
protects the crab.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—Except in the drier regions of North America
the hydra can usually be found by careful search in fresh-water ponds
not too stagnant. It is found attached to stones, sticks, or leaves,
and has a slender, cylindrical body from a quarter to half an
inch long, varying in thickness from that of a fine
needle to that of a common pin. The green hydra
and the brown hydra, both very small, are common
species, though hydras are often white or colourless.
They should be kept in a large glass dish filled with
water. They may be distinguished by the naked
eye but are not studied satisfactorily without a
magnifying glass or microscope. Place a living specimen attached
to a bit of wood in a watch crystal filled with water, or on a hollowed
slip, or on a slip with a bit of weed to support the cover
glass, and examine with hand lens or lowest power of microscope.
Prepared microscopical sections, both transverse and longitudinal,
may be bought
of dealers in microscopic
supplies. One is
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Is the hydra’s
<b>body</b>
round or two-sided?
(Fig.
<a href='#fig_035'>35</a>.) What is
its <i>general shape</i>? Does one individual keep the same
shape? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>.) How does the length of the threadlike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>tentacles</i> compare with the length of the hydra’s body?
About how many tentacles are on a hydra’s body? Do all
have the same number of tentacles? Are the tentacles
knotty or smooth? (Fig. <a href='#fig_035'>35</a>.) The hydra is usually extended
and slender; sometimes it is contracted and rounded.
In which of these conditions is the base (the foot) larger
around than the rest of the body? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>.) Smaller?
How many <i>openings</i> into the
body are visible? Is there a
depression or an eminence at
the base of the tentacles? For
what is the <i>opening</i> on top of
the body probably used? Why
are the tentacles placed at the
top of the hydra’s body? Does
the <i>mouth</i> have the most convenient
location possible?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The conical projection bearing
the <i>mouth</i> is called <i>hypostome</i>
(Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>). The mouth
opens into the <i>digestive cavity</i>.
Is this the same as the general
body cavity, or does the stomach have a wall distinct from
the <i>body cavity</i>? How far down does the body cavity
extend? Does it extend up into the tentacles? (Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>.)</p>

<p class='c017'>If a <i>tentacle is touched</i>, what happens? Is the body ever bent?
Which is more sensitive, the columnar body or the tentacles? In
searching for hydras would you be more likely to find the tentacles
extended or drawn in? Is the hypostome ever extended
or drawn in? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Locomotion.</b>—The round surface, or disk, by which the
hydra is attached, is called its foot. Can you move on
one foot without hopping? The hydra moves by alternately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>elongating and rounding the foot. Can you discover
other ways by which it moves? Does the hydra
always stand upon its foot?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Lasso Cells.</b>—Upon the tentacles (Fig. <a href='#fig_035'>35</a>) are numerous
cells provided each with a threadlike process (Fig. <a href='#fig_036'>36</a>)
which lies coiled within the
cell, but which may be
thrown out upon a water
flea, or other minute animal
that comes in reach. The
touch of the lasso paralyzes
the prey (Fig. <a href='#fig_037'>37</a>). These
cells are variously called
lasso cells, nettling cells, or
thread cells. The thread is
hollow and is pushed out by the pressure of liquid within.
When the pressure is withdrawn the thread goes back as
the finger of a glove may be turned back into the glove by
turning the finger outside in.
When a minute animal, or
other particle of food comes in
contact with a tentacle, how
does the tentacle get the food
to the mouth? By bending
and bringing the end to the
mouth, or by shortening and
changing its form, or in both
ways? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>, <i>C</i>.) Do the
neighbouring tentacles seem to
bend over to assist a tentacle in
securing prey? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>, <i>C</i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Digestion.</b>—The food particles
break up before remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>long in the stomach, and the nutritive part is absorbed
by the lining cells, or endoderm (Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>). The indigestible
remnants go out through the mouth. The hydra is
not provided with a special vent. Why could the vent not
be situated at the end opposite the mouth?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Circulation and Respiration.</b>—Does water have free
access to the body cavity? Does the hydra have few or
nearly all of its cells exposed to the water in which it
lives? From its structure, decide whether it can breathe
like a sponge or whether
special respiratory cells are
necessary to supply it with
oxygen and give off carbon
dioxide. Blood vessels are
unnecessary for transferring
oxygen and food from
cell to cell.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—Do you
see any swellings upon the
side of the hydra? (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>, A.) If the swelling is near
the tentacles, it is a <i>spermary</i>; if near the base, it is an
<i>ovary</i>. A sperm coalesces with or fertilizes the ovum after
the ovum is exposed by the breaking of the ovary wall.
Sometimes the sperm from one hydra unites with the ovum
of another hydra. This is called <i>cross-fertilization</i>. The
same term is applied to the process in plants when the
male element, developed in the pollen of the flower, unites
with the female element of the ovule of the flower on
another plant. The hydra, like most plants and some other
animals, is hermaphrodite, that is to say, both sperms and
ova are produced by one individual. In the autumn, eggs
are produced with hard shells to withstand the cold until
spring. Sexual reproduction takes place when food is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>scarce. Asexual generation (by budding) is common with
the hydra when food supply is abundant. After the bud
grows to a certain
size, the
outer layer of
cells at the base
of the bud constricts
and the
young hydra is
detached.</p>

Which
ranks higher
among the metazoa? The metazoa, or many-celled animals,
include all animals except which branch?</p>

<p class='c017'>Figure 39 is a <i>microscopic view</i> of a vertical section of a hydra to
show the <b>structure of the body wall</b>. There is an outer layer called the
<i>ectoderm</i>, and an inner layer called the <i>endoderm</i>. There is also a thin
supporting layer (black in the figure) called the <i>mesoglea</i>. The mesoglea
is the thinnest layer. Are the cells larger in the endoderm or the ectoderm?
Do both layers of cells assist in forming the reproductive bud? The ectoderm
cells end on the inside in contractile tails which form a thin line and
have the effect of muscle fibres. They serve the hydra for its remarkable
changes of shape. When the hydra is cut in pieces, each piece makes a
complete hydra, provided it contains both endoderm and ectoderm.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>In what ways does the hydra show “<b>division of labour</b>”? Answer
this by explaining the classes of cells specialized to serve a different
purpose. Which cells of the hydra are least specialized? In what particulars
is the plan of the hydra different from that of a simple sponge?
An ingenious naturalist living more than a century ago, asserted that it
made no difference to the hydra whether the ectoderm or the endoderm
layer were outside or inside,—that it could digest equally well with
either layer. He allowed a hydra to swallow a worm attached to a
thread, and then by gently pulling in the thread, turned the hydra inside
out. More recently a Japanese naturalist showed that the hydra could
easily be turned inside out, but he also found that when left to itself
it soon reversed matters and returned to its natural condition, that
the <b>cells are really specialized</b> and each layer can do its own work and
no other.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Habits.</b>—The hydra’s whole body is a hollow bag, the
cavity extending even into the tentacles. The tentacles
may increase in number as the hydra grows but seldom
exceed eight. The hydra has more active motion than
locomotion. It seldom moves from its place, but its tentacles
are constantly bending, straightening, contracting,
and expanding. The body is also usually in motion, bending
from one side to another. When the tentacles approach
the mouth with captured prey, the mouth (invisible
without a hand lens) opens widely, showing five lobes or
lips, and the booty is soon tucked within. A hydra can
swallow an animal larger in diameter than itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>endoderm</b> cells have <i>amœboid motion</i>, that is, they
extend pseudopods. They also resemble amœbas in the
power of <i>intra-cellular digestion</i>; that is, they absorb the
harder particles of food and digest them afterwards, rejecting
the indigestible portions. Some of these cells have
<i>flagella</i> (see Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>) which keep the fluid of the cavity
in constant motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes the <b>hydra moves</b> after the manner of a small
caterpillar called a “measuring worm,” that is, it takes
hold first by the foot, then by the tentacles, looping its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>body at each step. Sometimes
the body goes end over end in
slow somersaults.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>eats and digests for the group, another defends by nettling
cells, another produces eggs. Each hydra-like part of a
hydroid is called a <i>hydranth</i>. Sometimes the buds on the
hydra remain attached so long that a bud forms upon the
first bud. Thus three generations are represented in one
organism. Such growths show us that it is not always

devoted itself to a special function of digestion, defence, or

that is to produce the
eggs falls off</i> and becomes
independent of
the colony. More surprising
still, its appearance
changes entirely and instead of being hydra-like, it
becomes the large and complex creature called  <i>jellyfish</i>
(Fig. <a href='#fig_043'>43</a>). But
the <i>egg of the
jellyfish</i> produces
a small
<i>hydra-like animal</i>
which gives
rise by budding
to a <i>hydroid</i>,
and the cycle is
complete.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bud (or
reproductive
hydranth)  of
the  hydroid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>does not produce a hydroid, but a jellyfish; the egg of the
jellyfish does not produce a jellyfish, but a hydroid. This is
called by zoologists, <i>alternation of generations</i>. A <i>complete
individual</i> is the life from the germination of one egg to
the production of another. So that an “individual” consists
of a hydroid colony fixed in one place together with
all the jellyfish produced from its buds, which may
now be floating miles away from it in the ocean. Bathers
in the surf are sometimes touched and stung by the long,
streamer-like tentacles of the jellyfish. These, like the
tentacles of the hydra, have
nettling cells (Fig. <a href='#fig_041'>41</a>).</p>

salt water relatives of the hydra
produce buds which remain

however, becoming different
from the parent in any way.
The <i>coral polyps</i> and <i>corallines</i> are examples of <i>colonies</i> of
this kind, possessing a common stalk which is formed as
the process of multiplication goes on. In the case of coral
polyps, the separate animals and the flesh connecting them
secrete within themselves a hard, <i>limy, supporting structure
known as coral</i>. In some species, the coral, or stony part,
is so developed that the polyp seems to be inserted in the
coral, into which it withdraws itself for partial protection
(Fig. <a href='#fig_045'>45</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>corallines</i> secrete a smooth stalk which affords
no protection, but they also secrete a coating or sheath
which incloses both themselves and the stalk. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>coating has apertures through which the polyps protrude
in order to feed when no danger is near (Fig. <a href='#fig_046'>46</a>).
The red “corals” used for jewelry are bits of stalks of corallines.
The corallines (Figs. <a href='#fig_047'>47</a>, <a href='#fig_048'>48</a>) are not so abundant
nor so important
as the coral polyps

<p class='c011'><b>External Features.</b>—Starfish
are usually brown
or yellow.  Why? (See
Fig. <a href='#fig_052'>52</a>.) Has it a head or
a tail? Right and left sides?
What is the shape of the
<i>disk</i>, or part which bears
the five arms or <i>rays</i>? (Fig. <a href='#fig_053'>53</a>.) Does the body as a whole
have symmetry on two sides of a line (bilateral symmetry), or
around a point (radial symmetry)? Do the separate rays have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>bilateral symmetry? The <i>skeleton</i> consists of limy plates embedded
in the tough skin (Fig. <a href='#fig_054'>54</a>). Is the <i>skin</i> rough or smooth? Hard
or soft? Are the projections (or <i>spines</i>)
in the skin long or short? The skin is
hardened by the
limy plates, except
around the
<i>mouth</i>, which is
at the centre of
the lower side and surrounded by a membrane.
Which is rougher, the mouth side,
(<i>oral</i> side) or the opposite (<i>aboral</i> side)?
Which side is more nearly flat? The
<i>vent</i> is at or near the centre of the
disk on the aboral surface. It is usually
very small and sometimes absent. Why a vent is not of much
use will be understood after learning how the starfish takes food.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>An organ peculiar to animals of this
branch, and called the <i>madreporic plate</i>,
or <i>madreporite</i>, is found on the aboral
surface between the bases of two rays
(Fig. <a href='#fig_055'>55</a>). It is wartlike, and usually
white or red. This plate is a <i>sieve</i>; the
small openings keep out sand but allow
water to filter through.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Movements: the Water-tube System.</b>—The
water, which is filtered through
the perforated madreporite, is needed
to supply a <i>system of canals</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_056'>56</a>).
The madreporite opens into a canal
called the <i>stone canal</i>, the wall of which
is hardened by the same kind of material
as that found in the skin. The stone
canal leads to the <i>ring canal</i> which surrounds
the mouth (Fig. <a href='#fig_056'>56</a>). The ring
canal sends <i>radial canals</i> into each ray to supply the double row
of <i>tube feet</i> found in the groove at the lower side of each ray
(Fig. <a href='#fig_057'>57</a>). Because of their arrangement in rows, the feet are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>also called <i>ambulacral</i> feet (Latin <i>ambulacra</i>, “forest walks”).
There is a water holder (<i>ampulla</i>), or muscular water bulb at the
base of each
tube foot (Fig.
<a href='#fig_058'>58</a>). These contract
and force
the water into
the tube feet and
extend them.
The cuplike
ends of the
tubes cling to
the ground by
suction. The
feet contain
delicate muscles
by which they
contract and
shorten. Thus
the animal pulls
itself slowly
along, hundreds of feet acting together. The tube feet, for their
own protection, may contract and retire into the groove, the
water which extended them being sent back into the ampulla.
This system of water
vessels (or water-vascular
system) of
the echinodermata
is characteristic of
them; <i>i.e.</i> is not
found elsewhere in
the animal kingdom.
The grooves and the
plates on each side
of them occupy the
<i>ambulacral areas</i>. The rows of spines on each side of the grooves
are freely movable. (What advantage?) The spines on the aboral
surface are not freely movable.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><b>Respiration.</b>—The <i>system of water vessels serves the additional
purpose</i> of bringing water containing oxygen into contact with
various parts of the body, and the starfish was formerly thought
to have no special respiratory organs. However, there are holes in
the aboral wall through which the folds of the delicate lining membrane
protrude. These are now supposed to be <i>gills</i> (<i>k</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_058'>58</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The nervous system</b> is so close to the aboral surface that much
of it is visible without dissection. Its chief parts are a <i>nerve ring</i>
around the mouth, which sends off a <i>branch</i> along each ray.
These branches may be seen by separating the
rows of tube feet. They end in a pigmented
cell at the end of each ray called the <i>eye-spot.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><b>The food</b> of starfish consists of such animals
as crabs, snails, and oysters. When the prey
is too large to be taken into the mouth, the
starfish <i>turns its stomach inside out</i> over
the prey (Fig. <a href='#fig_059'>59</a>). After the shells separate,
the stomach is applied to the soft digestible
parts. After the animal is eaten, the stomach
is retracted. This odd way of eating is very
economical to its digestive powers, for <i>only
that part of the food which can be digested and absorbed is taken
into the body</i>. Only the lower part of the stomach is wide and
extensible. The upper portion (next to the aboral surface) is
not so wide. This portion receives the secretion from five
pairs of digestive glands, a pair of which is situated in each ray.
Jaws and teeth are absent. (Why?) The vent is sometimes
wanting. Why?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—There is a pair of ovaries at the base of each
ray of the female starfish (Fig. <a href='#fig_058'>58</a>). The spermaries of the male
have the same position and form as the ovaries, but they are
of a lighter colour, usually white.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. The sperm cells and egg cells are poured out into the water by the adults,
and the sperm cell, which, like nearly all sperm cells, has a vibratory, taillike
flagellum to propel it, reaches and fertilizes the egg cell.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Regeneration after Mutilation.</b>—If a starfish loses one or more
rays, they are replaced by growth. Only a very ignorant oysterman,
angry at the depredations of starfish upon his oyster beds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>would chop starfish to pieces, as this only serves to multiply them.
This power simulates multiplication by division in the simplest
animals.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Steps in Advance of Lower Branches.</b>—The starfish and other
echinodermata have a more developed nervous system, sensory
organs, and digestion, than forms previously studied; most distinctive
of all, they have a body
cavity distinct from the food
cavity. The digestive glands,
reproductive glands, and the
fluid which serves imperfectly
for blood, are in the body
cavity. There is no heart or
blood vessels. The motions
of the stomach and the bending
of the rays give motion to
this fluid in the body cavity.
It cannot be called blood,
but it contains white blood
corpuscles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The starfish when first
hatched is an actively swimming
bilateral animal, but it soon becomes starlike (Fig. <a href='#fig_060'>60</a>). The
limy plates of the starfish belong neither to the outer nor to the inner
layer (endoderm and ectoderm) of the body wall, but to a third
or middle layer (mesoderm); for echinoderms, like the polyps,
belong to the three-layered animals. In this its skeleton differs
from the shell of a crawfish, which is formed by the hardening
of the skin itself.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Protective Coloration.</b>—Many starfish are brown or yellow. This
makes them inconspicuous on the brown rocks or yellow sand.
Brightly coloured species are usually chosen for aquaria.</p>

of the sea urchin, consisting
of madreporite, tubes, and
water bulbs, or ampullæ, is
similar to that of the starfish.
The tube feet and locomotion are alike. There is no need for
well-developed respiratory organs in either animal, as the whole
body, inside and out, is bathed in water. The method of reproduction
is the same.</p>

its food tube is longer than that of a starfish, just as the food tube
of a sheep, whose food digests slowly, is much longer than that of
a dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>The largest species of sea urchins are almost as big as a

live on sandy shores, other species live
upon the rocks. The sand dollars are
of a lighter colour. (Why)? They are usually
flatter and have lighter, thinner
walls than the other species. The five-holed
sand cake or sand dollar has its
weight still further diminished by the

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Suggestions</span>:—Earthworms may be found in the daytime after
a heavy rain, or by digging or turning over planks, logs, etc., in
damp places. They may be found on the surface at night by
searching with a lantern. Live specimens may be kept in the
laboratory in a box packed with damp (not wet) loam and dead
leaves. They may be fed on bits of fat meat, cabbage, onion,
etc., dropped on the surface. When studying live worms, they
should be allowed to crawl on damp paper or wood. An earthworm
placed in a glass tube with rich, damp soil, may be watched
from day to day.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>External Features.</b>—Is the body <i>bilateral</i>? Is there a
<i>dorsal</i> and a <i>ventral</i> surface? Can you show this by a test
with live worm? Do you know of an animal with dorsal
and ventral surface, but not
bilateral?</p>

<p class='c011'>Can you make out a head?
A head end? A neck? Touch
the head and test whether it
can be made to crawl backwards. Which end is more
tapering? Is the mouth at the tip of the head end or on
the upper or lower surface? How is the <i>vent</i> situated?
Its shape? As the worm lies on a horizontal surface, is
the body anywhere flattened? Are there any very distinct
divisions in the body? Do you see any <i>eyes</i>?</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Experiment</b> to find whether the worm is sensitive (1) to <i>touch</i>,
(2) to <i>light</i>, (3) to strong <i>odours</i>, (4) to irritating liquids. Does it
show a sense of <i>taste</i>? The experiments should show whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>it avoids or seeks a bright light, as of a window; also whether any
parts of the body are especially sensitive to touch, or all equally
sensitive. What effect when a bright light is brought suddenly near
it at night?</p>

<p class='c011'>Is <i>red blood</i> visible through the skin? Can you notice
any <i>pulsations</i> in a vessel along the back? Do all earthworms
have the same number of <i>divisions</i> or rings? Compare
the size of the rings or segments. Can it crawl faster
on glass or on paper?</p>

<p class='c011'>A magnifying glass will show on most species tiny bristle-like
projections called <i>setæ</i>. How are the setæ arranged?
(<i>d</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_070'>70</a>.) How many on
one ring of the worm? How
do they point? Does the worm
feel smoother when it is pulled
forward or backward between
the fingers? Why? Are setæ on the lower surface?
Upper surface? The sides? What is the
use of the setæ? Are they useful below ground?
Does the worm move at a uniform rate? What
change in form occurs as the front part of the
body is pushed forward? As the hinder part is
pulled onward? How far does it go at each
movement? At certain seasons a broad band,
or ring, appears, covering several segments and
making them seem enlarged (Fig. <a href='#fig_071'>71</a>). This is
the <i>clitellum</i>, or <i>reproductive girdle</i>. Is this girdle
nearer the mouth or the tail?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Dorsal and Ventral Surfaces.</b>—The earthworm
always crawls with the same surface to the ground; this
is called the <i>ventral</i> surface, the opposite surface is the
<i>dorsal</i> surface. This is the first animal studied to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>these terms are applicable. What are the
ventral and dorsal surfaces of a fish, a frog,

</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The name “worm”</b> is often carelessly applied
to various crawling things in general. It is properly
applied, however, only to <i>segmented animals
without jointed appendages</i>.
Although a caterpillar crawls,
it is not a worm for several
reasons. It has six jointed
legs, and it is not a developed
animal, but only an early stage
in the life of a moth or a butterfly.
A “grubworm” also
has jointed legs (Fig. <a href='#fig_167'>167</a>).
It does not remain a grub, but
in the adult stage is a beetle.
A worm never develops into
another animal in the latter
part of its life; its setæ are
not jointed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The Food Tube.</b>—The earthworm has
no teeth, and the food tube, as might be
inferred from the form of the
body, is simple and straight. Its
parts, recognizable because of
slight differences in size and
structure, are named the pharynx
(muscular), gullet, crop, gizzard
(muscular), and stomach-intestine. The last extends
through three fourths of the length of the
body (Fig. <a href='#fig_072'>72</a>). The functions of the parts of
the food tube are indicated by their names.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 74.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Circulation.</b>—There is a <i>large dorsal</i> blood
vessel above the food tube (Fig. <a href='#fig_073'>73</a>). From the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>front portion of this tube arise several large tubular rings
or “hearts” which are contractile and serve to keep the
blood circulating. They lead to a <i>ventral vessel</i> below the
food tube (Fig. <a href='#fig_074'>74</a>). The blood is red, but the <i>colouring
matter</i> is in the liquid, not in the blood cells.</p>

<div id='fig_075'  class='figleft id069'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 75.</span>—<span class='sc'>Ganglia near Mouth</span> and part of nerve chain of earthworm.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Nervous System.</b>—Between the ventral blood vessels
is a <i>nerve cord</i> composed of two strands (see Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>).
There is a slight swelling, or <i>ganglion</i>, on each strand, in
each segment (Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>). The strands separate
near the front end of the worm, and a
branch goes up each side of the gullet and
enters the two pear-shaped <i>cerebral ganglia</i>,
or “brain” (Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Food.</b>—The earthworm eats earth containing
organic matter, the inorganic part passing
through the vent in the form of circular casts;
these are found in the morning at the top of
the earthworm’s burrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earthworm has no teeth. It excretes
through the mouth an <i>alkaline fluid</i> which
softens and partly digests the food before it
is eaten. When this fluid is poured out upon a green leaf,
the leaf at once turns brown. The starch in the leaf is
also acted upon. The snout aids in pushing the food into
the mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Kidneys.</b>—Since oxidation is occurring in its tissues,
and impurities are forming, there must be some way of
<i>removing impurities from the tissues</i>. The earthworm
does not possess one-pair organs like the kidneys of
higher animals to serve this purpose, but it has numerous
pairs of small tubular organs called <i>nephridia</i> which serve
the purpose. Each one is simply a tube with several coils.
There is a pair on the floor of each segment. Each nephridium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>has an inner open end within the body cavity, and
its outer end opens by a pore on the surface between the
setæ. The nephridia absorb waste
from the liquid in the <i>celom</i>, or body
cavity surrounding the food tube,
and convey it to the outside.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Respiration.</b>—The skin of the
earthworm is moist, and the blood
capillaries approach so near to the
surface of the body that the oxygen
is constantly passing in from the air,
and carbon dioxide passing out; hence
it is constantly breathing through all parts of its skin.
<i>It needs no lungs</i> nor special respiratory organs of any
kind.</p>

<div id='fig_077'  class='figleft id071'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 77.</span>—Sperm (<i>sp</i>) and egg glands (<i>es</i>) of worm.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><b>Reproduction.</b>—When one individual animal produces both
sperm cells and egg cells, it is said to be hermaphrodite. This
is true of the earthworm. The egg cell
is always fertilized, however, not by the
sperm cells of the same worm, but by
sperm cells formed by another worm.
The openings of these <i>ovaries</i> consist of
two pairs of small pores found in most
species on the ventral surface of the
fourteenth segment (see Fig. <a href='#fig_077'>77</a>). There
are also two pairs of small <i>receptacles</i>
for temporarily holding the <i>foreign sperm
cells</i>. One pair of the openings from
these receptacles is found (with difficulty)
in the wrinkle behind the ninth
segment (Fig. <a href='#fig_077'>77</a>), and the other pair
behind the tenth segment. The <i>spermaries</i>
are in front of the ovaries (Fig. <a href='#fig_077'>77</a>), but the <i>sperm ducts</i>
are longer than the <i>oviducts</i>, and open behind them on the fifteenth
segment (Figs. <a href='#fig_077'>77</a>, <a href='#fig_078'>78</a>). The worms exchange sperm cells, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>egg cells. The reproductive girdle, or <i>clitellum</i>, already spoken of,
forms the case which is to hold the eggs (see Fig. <a href='#fig_071'>71</a>). When the
sperm cells have been exchanged, and the ova are ready for fertilization,
the worm draws itself backward from the collar-like case or
clitellum so that this slips over the head. As it passes the fourteenth
segment, it collects the ova, and as it passes the ninth and
tenth segments, it collects the sperm cells previously
received from another worm. The elastic, collar-like
clitellum closes at the ends after it has slipped over the
worm’s head, forming a <i>capsule</i>. The ova are <i>fertilized
in this capsule</i>, and some of them hatch into worms in
a few days. These devour the eggs which do not
hatch. The eggs develop into complete but very
small worms before escaping from the capsule.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Habits.</b>—The earthworm is <i>omnivorous</i>. It
will eat bits of meat as well as leaves and
other vegetation. It has also the advantage,
when digging its hole, of <i>eating the earth</i> which
must be excavated. Every one has noticed the
fresh “casts” piled up at the holes in the morning.
As the holes are partly filled by rains, the
casts are most abundant after rains. The chief
<i>enemies</i> of the earthworm are moles and birds.
The worms <i>work at night</i> and retire so early in
the morning that the very early bird has the
advantage in catching worms. Perhaps the nearest to
an intelligent act the earthworm accomplishes is to <i>conceal
the mouth of its hole</i> by plugging it with a pebble or
a bit of leaf. Worms <i>hibernate</i>, going below danger of
frost in winter. In dry weather they burrow several feet
deep.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The muscular coat</b> of the body wall is much thicker than
the skin. It consists of two layers: an outer <i>layer of fibres
which run around the body</i> just beneath the skin, and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>inner, thicker <i>layer of fibres which run lengthwise</i>. The
worm crawls by shortening the longitudinal muscles. As
the bristles (<i>setæ</i>) point backward, they prevent the front
part of the body from slipping back, so the hinder part is
drawn forward. Next, the circular muscles contract, and
the bristles preventing the hind part from slipping back,
the fore portion is pushed forward. Is the worm thicker
when the hinder part is being pulled up or when the fore
part is being thrust forward? Does the earthworm pull or
push itself along, or does it do both? Occasionally it travels
backward, <i>e.g.</i> it sometimes goes backward into its hole.
Then the bristles are directed forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>The right and left halves of the body are counterparts of
each other, hence the earthworm is <i>bilaterally symmetrical</i>.
The lungs and the gills of animals must always be kept
moist. The worm <i>cannot live long in dry air</i>, for respiration
in the skin ceases when it cannot be kept moist, and the
worm smothers. Long immersion in water is injurious to it,
perhaps because there is far less oxygen in water than in
the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Darwin wrote a book called “Vegetable Mould and Earthworms.”
He estimated that there were fifty thousand earthworms
to the acre on farm land in England, and that they
bring up eighteen tons of soil in an acre each year. As
the acids of the food tube act upon the mineral grains that
pass through it, the earthworm renders <i>great aid in forming
soil</i>. By burrowing it makes the soil more <i>porous</i> and
brings up the subsoil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although without eyes, the worm is sensitive to light
falling upon its anterior segments. When the light of a
lantern suddenly strikes it at night, it crawls quickly to its
burrow. Its sense of touch is so keen that it can detect a
light puff of breath. Which of the foods kept in a box of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>damp earth disappeared first? What is indicated as to a
sense of taste?</p>

<p class='c011'>Why is the bilateral type of structure better adapted for
development and higher organization than the radiate type
of the starfish? The earthworm’s body is a
double tube; the hydra’s body is a single
tube; which plan is more advantageous, and
why? Would any other colour do just as well
for an earthworm? Why, or why not?</p>

<p class='c017'>The <i>sandworm</i> (Nereis) lives in the sand of the
seashore, and swims in the sea at night (Fig. <a href='#fig_079'>79</a>).
It is more advanced in structure than the earthworm,
as it has a distinct head (Fig. <a href='#fig_080'>80</a>), eyes, two
teeth, two lips, and several pairs of antennæ, and
two rows of muscular projections which serve as
feet. It is much used by fishermen for bait. If
more easily obtained, it may be studied instead of
the earthworm.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><b>There are four classes in the branch Vermes</b>:
1) the <i>worms</i>, including sandworms and leeches; 2) the
<i>roundworms</i>, including trichina, hairworms,
and vinegar eels; 3) <i>flatworms</i>, including
tapeworm and liver fluke; 4) <i>rotifers</i>, which
are microscopic aquatic forms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>tapeworm</b> is a flatworm which has lost
most of its organs on account of its parasitic
life. Its egg is picked up by an herbivorous
animal when grazing. The embryo undergoes
only partial development in the body
of the herbivorous animal, <i>e.g.</i> an ox. The
next stage will not develop until the beef is eaten by a
carnivorous animal, to whose food canal it attaches itself
and soon develops a long chain of segments called a
“tape.” Each segment absorbs fluid food through its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>body wall. As the segments at the older end mature,
each becomes full of eggs, and the segments become
detached and pass out of the canal, to be dropped and
perhaps picked up by an herbivorous animal and the
life cycle is repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>trichina</b> is more dangerous to human life than is the
tapeworm. It gets into the food canal in uncooked pork
(bologna sausage, for example), multiplies there, migrates
into the muscles, causing great pain, and encysts there,
remaining until the death of the host. It is believed to
get into the bodies of hogs again when they eat rats, which
in turn have obtained the cysts from carcasses.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Summary of the Biological Process.</b>—An earthworm is
<i>a living machine which does work</i> (digging and crawling;
seizing, swallowing, and digesting food; pumping blood;
growing and reproducing). To do the work it must have
a continual <i>supply of energy</i>. The energy for its work is
set free by the protoplasm (in its microscopic cells) undergoing
a destructive chemical change (<i>oxidation</i>). The
waste products from the breaking down of the protoplasm
must be continually removed (<i>excretion</i>). The broken-down
protoplasm must be continually replaced if life is to
continue (the income must exceed the outgo if the animal
is still growing). The microscopic cells construct more
protoplasm out of food and oxygen (<i>assimilation</i>) supplied
them by the processes of nutrition (eating, digesting,
breathing, circulating). This protoplasm in turn oxidizes
and releases more energy to do work, and thus the cycle
of life proceeds.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—In regions where crayfish are not found, a live
crab may be used. Locomotion and behaviour may be studied by
providing a tub of water, or better, a large glass jar such as a
broad candy jar. For suggestions on study of internal structure,
see p. <a href='#Page_58'>58</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Habitat.</b>—Do you often see crawfish, or crayfish, moving
about, even in water where they are known to be abundant?
What does your answer suggest as to the time
when they are probably most active?</p>

<p class='c011'>Why do you never see one building its chimney, even
where crayfish holes are abundant? Is the chimney
always of the same colour as the surface soil? Are the
crayfish holes only of use for protection? In what kind
of spots are crayfish always dug; Why? What
becomes of crayfish when the pond or the creek dries up?
How deep are the holes? How large are the lumps of
mud of which the chimney is built? How does it get
them out of the hole? Why is the mud built into a chimney
instead of thrown away? (What would happen to a
well with its mouth no higher than the ground?) Why
are crayfish scarce in rocky regions?</p>

<p class='c011'>How does the colour of the crayfish compare with its
surroundings? Is its colour suited to live in clear or muddy
water? Define protective colouration.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><b>Habits.</b>—Does the crayfish walk better in water or out
of it? Why? Does it use the legs with the large claws
to assist in walking? Do the swimmerets (under the abdomen)
move fast or slow? (Observe it from below in a
large jar of clear water.) What propels it backward?
Forward? Does the crayfish move at a more uniform
rate when swimming backward or forward? Why? In
which way can it swim more rapidly? Do the big legs
with claws offer more resistance to the water while it is
swimming backward or forward? How does it hold the
tail after the stroke, while it is darting backward through
the water? Hold a crayfish with its tail submerged and
its head up. Can the tail strike the water with much
force? Allow it to grasp a pencil: can it sustain its own
weight by its grip?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Feeding.</b>—Offer several kinds of food to a crayfish that
has not been alarmed or teased. Does it prefer bread,
meat, or vegetables? How does it get the food to its mouth?
Does it eat rapidly or slowly? Does it tear the food with
the big pincers? Can it gnaw with the small appendages
near the mouth?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Breathing.</b>—Does the crayfish breathe with gills or
lungs? Place a few drops of ink near the base of the hind
legs of a crayfish resting quietly in shallow water. Where
is the ink drawn in? Where does it come out? To explain
the cause and the purpose of this motion, place a crayfish
in a large glass jar containing water, and see the
vibratory motion of the parts under the front portion of
the body. There is under the shell on each side of the body
a gill paddle, or gill bailer, that moves at the same rate.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Senses.</b>—Crayfish are best caught with a piece of meat
or beef’s liver tied to a string. Do they always lose hold
as soon as they are lifted above the water? What do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>conclude as to the alertness of their senses? Does the covering
of their bodies suggest the possession of a delicate or
a dull sense of touch?</p>

<p class='c011'>Of what motions are the <i>eyes</i> capable? Touch one of
the eyes. The result? Can a crayfish see in all directions?
To test this, place a crayfish on a table and try
whether you can move to a place where you can see the
crayfish without seeing its eyes. What are the advantages
and disadvantages of having the eyes on stalks?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Tail.</b>—How many joints, or segments, of the tail? (Figs.
<a href='#fig_081'>81</a>, <a href='#fig_083'>83</a>.) Does the hard covering of each segment slip
under or over the segment behind it when
the tail is straight? Does this lessen
friction while swimming forward?</p>

<p class='c011'>Is there a pair of <i>swimmerets</i> to each
segment of the tail? (Figs. <a href='#fig_082'>82</a>, <a href='#fig_086'>86</a>.)
Notice that each swimmeret has a main
stalk (protopod), an outer branch (exopod),
and an inner branch (endopod) (Fig. <a href='#fig_084'>84</a>).
Are the stalk and the branches each in

<p class='c011'><b>Carapace.</b>—The covering of the head
chest (cephalothorax) is called the carapace.
Has it free edges? The <i>gills</i> are
on the sides of the body and are covered
by the carapace (Fig. <a href='#fig_087'>87</a>). The projection
in front is called the <i>rostrum</i>, meaning beak.
Does the rostrum project beyond the eyes?
There is a transverse groove across the carapace
which may
be said to divide
the head from the
abdomen. Where
does this groove end at the sides?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Legs.</b>—How many legs has the
crayfish? How many are provided

Is the outer claw hinged in each
of the large grasping pincers?
The inner claw?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Appendages for Taking Food.</b>—If
possible to watch a living crayfish
eating, notice whether it places
the food directly into the mouth with the large claws. Bend
the large claws under and see if they will reach the mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Attached just in front of the legs the crayfish has three
pairs of finger-like appendages, called foot jaws (maxillipeds),
with which it passes the food from the large pincers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to its mouth (Figs. <a href='#fig_085'>85</a>, <a href='#fig_086'>86</a>). They are in form and in use
more like fingers than feet. In front of the foot jaws are two
pairs of thin jaws
(maxillæ) and in
front of the thin
jaws are a pair of
stout jaws (mandibles)
(Fig. <a href='#fig_085'>85</a>). Do
the jaws move
sidewise or up
and down? Which
of the jaws has a
jointed finger (palp) attached to it? Do all the appendages
for taking food have both exopod and endopod
branches on a basal stalk or protopod? Which of the
appendages have a scalloped edge? How would you know
from looking at the crayfish that it is not merely a

are the eyestalks? Is the stalk flexible or stiff? Touch the
eye. Where is the joint which enables the stalk to move?
Is the outer covering of the eye hard or soft? A mounted
preparation of the transparent covering (cornea) of the
eye, seen with lower power of microscope, reveals that the
cornea is made up of many divisions, called facets. Each
facet is the front of a very small eye, hundreds of which
make up the whole eye, which is therefore called a compound
eye. The elongated openings to the <i>ear sacs</i> are
located each on the upper side of the base of a small feeler
just below the eye.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Respiratory System.</b>—The respiratory organs are gills
located on each side of the thorax in a space between the
carapace and the body (Fig. <a href='#fig_087'>87</a>). The gills are white, curved,
and feathery. Is the front gill the largest or the smallest?
The gills overlap each other; which is the outermost gill?
On the second maxilla is a thin, doubly curved plate called
a gill bailer (Fig. <a href='#fig_085'>85</a>). The second maxilla is so placed
that the gill bailer comes at the front end of the gill
chamber. The bailer paddles continually, bringing the
water forward out of the gill. The gills are attached
below at the base of the legs. Are the gills thick or thin?
How far upward do they go? Does the backward motion
in swimming aid or hinder the passage of the water through
the gills? Does a crayfish, when at rest on the bottom
of a stream, have its head up or down stream? Why?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Openings.</b>—The slitlike <i>vent</i> is on the under side of
the telson (Figs. <a href='#fig_082'>82</a>, <a href='#fig_088'>88</a>). The <i>mouth</i> is on the under side
of the thorax behind the mandibles. At the base of the
long antennæ are the openings from the <i>green glands</i>, two
glands in the head which serve as kidneys (Fig. <a href='#fig_089'>89</a>).
The openings of the <i>reproductive organs</i> are on the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>pair of legs in the female, and the fifth
pair of legs in the male (Fig. <a href='#fig_088'>88</a>). The

<p class='c017'><b>The Food Tube.</b>—Is the stomach in the

large or small? What is its general shape?
Does the gullet lead upward or backward?
Is it long or short? (Fig. <a href='#fig_088'>88</a>.) The mid tube,
which is the next portion of the food tube, is
smaller than the stomach. On each side of
it are openings from the bile ducts which
bring the secretion from the digestive gland,
sometimes called the liver. Does this gland
extend the whole length of the thorax? Is
it near the floor or the top of the cavity?
The third and last portion of the food tube
is the intestine. It extends from the thorax
to the vent. Is it large
or small? Straight or
curved? The powerful
flexor muscles of the tail
lie in the abdomen below
the intestines. Compare
the size of these muscles
with the extensor muscle
above the intestine (Fig.
<a href='#fig_090'>90</a>). Why this difference?
Does the food tube extend

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 91.</span>—Showing heart and main blood vessels.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><b>The Circulation.</b>—The blood is a liquid containing <i>white corpuscles</i>.
It lacks red corpuscles and is colourless. The heart is in
the upper part of the thorax. It is surrounded
by a large, thin bag, and thus it is
in a chamber (called the <i>pericardial sinus</i>).
The blood from the pulmonary veins enters
this sinus before it enters the heart. The
origin of this pericardial sinus by the fusing of
veins is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_130'>130</a>. Does one artery,
or do several arteries, leave the heart? There
is a larger dorsal artery lying on the intestine
and passing back to the telson; there are
three arteries passing forward close to the
dorsal surface (Figs. <a href='#fig_089'>89</a>, <a href='#fig_091'>91</a>). One large artery
(the sternal) passes directly downward (Figs.
<a href='#fig_088'>88</a>, <a href='#fig_091'>91</a>), and sends a branch forward and
another backward near the ventral surface.
The openings into the heart from the sinus
have valvular lips which prevent a backward
flow of blood into the sinus. Hence, when
the heart contracts, the blood is sent out into the several
arteries. The arteries take a supply of fresh blood
to the eyes, stomach, muscles, liver, and the various
organs. After it has given oxygen to the several organs
and taken up carbon dioxide, it returns by veins to pass
through the gills on each side, where it gives out the useless
gas and takes up oxygen from the water. It is then
led upward by veins into the pericardial sinus again.</p>

<p class='c017'>The central nervous system consists of a <i>double
chain</i> of ganglia (Fig. <a href='#fig_092'>92</a>). This main nerve chain
lies along the ventral surface below the food tube
(Fig. <a href='#fig_090'>90</a>), except one pair of ganglia which lie
above the œsophagus or gullet (Fig. <a href='#fig_088'>88</a>), and are
called the supra-œsophageal ganglia, or brain.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Crustacea.</b>—The crayfish and its kindred are placed in

<p class='c011'><b>Decapods.</b>—All crustacea which have ten feet belong
in the order called decap´oda (ten-footed). This order
includes the crabs, lobsters, shrimp,
etc. The crabs and the lobsters are of
considerable importance because of
use as food. Small boys sometimes
catch crayfish, and in some instances
are known to cook and eat them for
amusement,
the only part cooked being the
muscular tail. The crab’s tail is
small and flat and held under the
body (Fig. <a href='#fig_093'>93</a>).</p>

Compare with metamorphoses of insects.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Since the limy covering to serve
the purpose of protection is not
soft enough to be alive and growing, it is evident that the
crustacea are hampered in their growth by their crusty
covering. During
the first
year the crayfish
sheds its
covering, or
<b>moults</b> three
times, and
once each year
thereafter. It
grows very fast
for a few days
just after moulting,
while the
covering is soft
and extensible.
Since it is at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>the mercy of birds, fish, and other enemies while in this
soft and defenceless condition, it stays hidden until the
covering hardens. Hence it cannot eat much, but probably
by the absorption of water the tissues grow; that is, enlarge.
In the intervening periods, when growth is impossible, it
develops; that is, the tissues and organs change in structure
and become stronger. “Soft-shelled crab” is a popular dish,
but there is no species by that name, this being only a crab
just after moulting which has been found by fishermen in
spite of its hiding.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>General Questions.</b>—How do crayfish choose their food?
How long can they live out of water? Why do their gills remain
moist out of water longer than a fish? How do they breathe
out of water? Are they courageous or cowardly animals? When
they lose appendages in fighting or moulting these are readily
reproduced, but an organ moults several times in regaining its
size. Have you seen crayfish with one claw smaller than the other?<a id='t61'></a>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>The Grasshopper</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—Collect grasshoppers, both young and full-grown,
and keep alive in broad bottles or tumblers and feed on
fresh grass or lettuce. When handling a live grasshopper, never
hold it by its legs, as the joints are weak. To keep them for
some time and observe their moults, place sod in the bottom of a
box and cover the box with mosquito netting or wire gauze.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 106.</span>—<span class='sc'>A Grasshopper.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>What is the <b>general shape</b> of its body? (Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>.)
Where is the body thickest? Is it bilaterally symmetrical,
that is, are the two sides of the
body alike? Is the <i>skeleton</i>, or hard
part of the body, internal or external?
Is the skeleton as stiff and thick
as that of a crayfish? What is the
length of your specimen? Its colour?
Why does it have this coloration? In what ways does the
grasshopper resemble the crayfish? Differ from it?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Three Regions of the Body.</b>—The body of the grasshopper
is divided into three regions—the <i>head</i>, the <i>thorax</i>,
and the <i>abdomen</i>. Which of these three divisions has no distinct
subdivisions? The body of the grasshopper, like that of
the earth worm, is made of <i>ringlike segments</i>. Are the segments
most distinct in the head, the thorax, or the abdomen?
Which region is longest? Shortest? Strongest? Why?
Which region bears the chief sense organs? The appendages
for taking food? The locomotory appendages?
Which division of the body is most active in breathing?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><b>The Abdomen.</b>—About how many segments or rings in
the abdomen? Do all grasshoppers have the same number
of rings? (Answer for different species and different
individuals of the same species.) The first segment and
the last two are incomplete rings. Does the flexibility of
the abdomen reside in the rings or in the joints between the
rings? Is there merely a thin, soft line between the rings,
or is there a fold of the covering? Does one ring slip into
the ring before it or behind it when the abdomen is bent?</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 107.</span>—<span class='sc'>A Grasshopper Dissected.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As the grasshopper <b>breathes</b>, does each ring enlarge
and diminish in size? Each <i>ring is divided into two parts</i>
by folds. Does the upper half-ring
overlap the lower half-ring, or the
reverse? With magnifying glass, find
a small slit, called a <i>spiracle</i>, or breathing
hole, on each side of each ring just
above the side groove (Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>). A
tube leads from each spiracle. While
the air is being taken in, do the two
portions of the rings move farther
apart? When they are brought
together again, what must be the
effect? In pumping the air, the abdomen may be said to
work like a bellows. Bellows usually have folds to allow
motion. Is the comparison correct?</p>

<p class='c011'>How many times in a minute does the grasshopper take
in air? If it is made to hop vigorously around the room
and the breathing is again timed, is there any change?</p>

<p class='c011'>Find the <b>ears</b> on the front wall of the <i>first abdominal
ring</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_107'>107</a>). They may be seen by slightly pressing
the abdomen so as to widen the chink between it and
the thorax. The ears are merely glistening, transparent
<i>membranes</i>, oval in form. A <i>nerve</i> leads from the inner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>surface of each membrane. State any advantage or disadvantage
in having the ears located where they are.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 108.</span>—<span class='sc'>Grasshopper Laying Eggs.</span> (Riley.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Ovipositor.</b>—If the specimen is a female, it has an egg-placer
or ovipositor, consisting of <i>four blunt projections</i> at
the end of the abdomen (Fig. <a href='#fig_107'>107</a>). If it is a male,
there are two appendages above the end of the abdomen,
and smaller than the parts of the ovipositor. Females
are larger and more abundant than males. In laying
the eggs, the four blunt points are brought tightly together
and then forced into the
ground and opened (Fig. <a href='#fig_108'>108</a>). By
repeating this, the grasshopper
makes a pit almost as deep as the
abdomen is long. The eggs are
laid in the bottom of the pit.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Draw</b> a side view of the grasshopper.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Thorax.</b>—This, the middle portion
of the body, consists of <i>three
segments</i> or rings (Fig. <a href='#fig_107'>107</a>). Is the division between the
rings most apparent above or below? Which two of the
three rings are more closely united?</p>

<p class='c011'>The front ring of the thorax is called <i>prothorax</i>. Is it
larger above or below? Does it look more like a collar
or a cape? (Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>.) A spiracle is found on the second
ring (<i>mesothorax</i>, or middle thorax) just above the second
pair of legs. There is another in the soft skin between
the prothorax and the mesothorax just under the large
cape or collar. The last ring of the thorax is called the
<i>metathorax</i> (rear thorax).</p>

<p class='c011'>How many <b>legs</b> are attached to each ring of the thorax?
Can a grasshopper walk? Run? Climb? Jump?
Fly? Do any of the legs set forward? (See Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Outward? Backward? Can you give reasons for the position
of each pair? (Suggestion: What is the use of each
pair?) If an organ is modified so that it is suited to serve
some particular purpose or function, it is said to be <i>specialized</i>.
Are any of the legs specialized so that they serve
for a purpose different from that of the other legs?</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 110.</span>—<span class='sc'>How a Spider Walks.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The leg of a grasshopper (as of all insects) is said to
have <i>five parts</i>, all the small parts after the first four parts
being counted as one part and called the foot. Are all the
legs similar, that is, do the short and the long joints in all
come in the same order? Numbered in order from the
body, which joint of the leg is the largest,—the first, second,
third, or fourth? Which joint is the shortest? The
slenderest? Which joint has a number of sharp points or
spines on it? Find by experiment whether these spines
are of use in walking (Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>). Jumping? Climbing?
In what order are the legs used in walking? How many
legs support the body at each step?</p>

<p class='c011'>All animals that have ears have ways of communicating
by <b>sounds</b>. Why would it be impossible for the grasshopper
to have a <i>voice</i>, even if it had vocal cords in its
throat? The male grasshoppers of many species make a
<b>chirping</b>, or stridulation, by rubbing the wing against the
leg. Look on the inner side (why not outer side?) of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>largest joint of the hind leg for a <i>row of small spines</i> visible
with the aid of a hand lens (Fig. <a href='#fig_111'>111</a>). The sound is
produced by the outer wings rubbing against the spines.
Have you noticed whether the sound is
produced while the insect is still or in
motion? Why? The male grasshoppers
of some species, instead of having
spines, rub the under side of the front
wing on the upper side of the hind wing.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Wings.</b>—To what is the first pair
of wings attached? The second pair?
Why are the wings not attached to the
prothorax? Why are the wings attached
so near the dorsal line of the body? Why are the second
and third rings of the thorax more solidly joined than the
first and second rings?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Compare the first and second pairs of wings in shape,
size, colour, thickness and use (Fig. <a href='#fig_112'>112</a>). How are the
second wings folded so as to go
under the first wings? About
how many folds in each?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Draw</b> a hind wing opened out.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Head.</b> What is the shape of
the head viewed from the front, the
side, and above? <i>Make sketches.</i>
What can you say of the neck? Is
the head movable in all directions?</p>

<p class='c011'>What is the position of the large
<b>eyes</b>? Like the eyes of the crayfish,
they are <i>compound, with many facets</i>. But the grasshopper
has also <i>three simple eyes</i>, situated one in the middle
of the forehead and one just above each antenna. They
are too small to be seen without a hand lens. How does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the grasshopper’s range of vision compare with that of the
crayfish?</p>

<p class='c011'>Are the <b>antennæ</b> flexible? What is their shape? Position?
Are they segmented? Touch an antenna, a wing,
a leg, and the abdomen in succession. Which seems to be
the most sensitive to touch? The antennæ
are for feeling. In some species of insects
they also are organs of hearing and smelling.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>mouth parts</b> of a grasshopper should
be compared with the mouth parts of a beetle
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_113'>113</a>, since they correspond
closely. If the grasshopper is fed with a
blade of fresh grass, the function of each organ may be
plainly seen. It is almost impossible to understand these
functions by studying a dead specimen, but a fresh specimen
is much better than a dry one.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The upper lip, or <i>labrum</i>, is seen in front. Is it tapering
or expanded? In what direction is it movable? The dark
pointed biting jaws (<i>mandibles</i>) are next. Are they curved
or straight? Sharp or blunt pointed? Notched or smooth?
Do they work up and down, or sideways? The holding jaws
(<i>maxillæ</i>), each with two jaw fingers (<i>maxillary palpi</i>), are
behind the chewing jaws. Why? The lower lip (<i>labium</i>)
has a pair of lip fingers (<i>labial palpi</i>) upon it. The brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>tongue, usually bathed in saliva, is seen in the lower part of
the mouth. Since the grasshopper has no lips, or any way
of producing suction, it must lap the dew in drinking. Does
it merely break off bits of a grass blade, or does it chew?</p>

<p class='c011'>The heart, circulation, nervous system, digestive and respiratory
organs of the grasshopper agree mainly with the
general description of the organs of insects given in the
next section.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Microscopic Objects.</b>—These may be bought ready
mounted, or may be examined fresh. A portion of the
covering of the large eye may be cut off and the dark layer
on the inside of the covering scraped off to make it transparent.
What is the shape of the facets? Can you make
any estimate of
their number? A
portion of the
transparent hind
wing may be used,
and the “veins”
in it studied. A
thin bit of an abdominal segment containing a spiracle
will show the structure of these important organs.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Growth of the Grasshopper.</b>—Some species hibernate in
sheltered places and lay eggs in the spring, but adult species
are scarce at that season. Most species lay the eggs in the
fall; these withstand the cold and hatch out in the spring.
Those hatched from one set of eggs sometimes stay together
for a few days. They eat voraciously, and as they grow, the
soft skin becomes hardened by the deposit of horny substance
called chitin. This retards further growth until the insect
moults, the skin first splitting above the prothorax. After
hatching, there are five successive periods of growth. At
which moult do the very short wings first appear? (Fig. <a href='#fig_115'>115</a>.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>After the last moult the animal is complete, and changes
no more in size for the rest of its life. There has been an
attempt among writers to restrict the term
grasshopper to the long-winged, slender
family, and to call the shorter winged,
stouter family locusts, according to old
English usage.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Economic Importance of Grasshoppers.</b>—Great
injury is often done to vegetation by
grasshoppers; however, the millions of tiny
but ravenous eaters hatched in early spring
are usually soon thinned out by the birds. The migratory
locusts constitute a plague when they appear, and
they have done so since ancient times. The Rocky Mountain
locusts flying eastward have darkened the sky, and
where they settled to the earth
ate almost every green thing.
In 1874–5 they produced almost
a famine in Kansas, Nebraska,
and other Western states. The young hatched away
from the mountains were not healthy,
and died prematurely, and their devastations
came to an end. Of course the
migrations may occur again. Packard
calculates that the farmers of the
West lost $200,000,000 because of grasshopper
ravages in 1874–5.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The <i>cockroaches</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_116'>116</a>), <b>kindred of the grasshoppers</b>,
are household pests that have migrated almost everywhere
that ships go. The <i>praying mantis</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_117'>117</a>), or <i>devil’s
horse</i>, also belongs to this order. It is beneficial, since it
destroys noxious insects. Which of its legs are specialized?
The <i>walking stick</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_121'>121</a>) and the <i>cricket</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_118'>118</a>), like
most members of the order, are vegetarian.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grasshoppers are very scarce
in Europe as they love dry,
warm countries. Why do locusts
migrate? Give an instance
in ancient times.</p>

<p class='c011'>How long do most grasshoppers
live? Does a grasshopper
spread its wings before

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Note to Teacher.</span>—<b>Field work in
Zoology</b> should be systematic. Every trip
has a definite region and definite line of
study in view, but every animal seen should be noted. The habitat, adaptation
by structure and habits to the environment, relations to other animals,
classification of animals seen, should be some of the ideas guiding the study.
The excursions may be divided somewhat as follows, according as opportunities
offer: Upland woods, lowland woods, upland pastures, fields, swamps, a fresh-water
lake, a pond, lower sea beach, higher sea beach, sand hills along shore,
roadside, garden, haunts of birds, insect visits to flowers, ground insects,
insects in logs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span><b>Collecting Insects.</b>—In cities and towns insects, varying
with the season, are attracted by electric lights. Beetles
and bugs will be found under the lights, moths on posts
near the lights, grasshoppers and crickets and other insects
in the grass near by. A lamp placed by a window
brings many specimens. In the woods and in rocky
places insects are found under logs and stones, and under
the bark of dead trees. In open places, prairies, meadows,
and old fields with grass and flowers, it will be easy to find
grasshoppers, butterflies, and some beetles. Ponds and
streams are usually rich in animal forms, such as bugs and
beetles, which swim on or under the surface, and larvæ
of dragon flies crawling on the bottom. Dragon flies and
other insects that lay eggs on the water are found flying
in the air above. (In the spring, newly hatched crayfish,
tadpoles, and the eggs of frogs and toads should also be
collected, if found.) Moths may be caught at night by
daubing molasses or syrup made from brown sugar upon
the trunks of several trees, and visiting the trees at intervals
with a lantern.</p>

<p class='c010'>An insect net for catching butterflies and for dredging
ponds may be made by bending a stout wire into a circle
one foot in diameter, leaving enough straight wire to
fasten with staples on an old broomstick. To the frame
is fastened a flour sack, or cone made of a piece of mosquito
netting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Butterflies and moths should be promptly killed, or
they will beat their wings to pieces. The quickest method
is by dropping several drops of gasoline upon the ventral
(under) side of the thorax and abdomen. (Caution:
Gasoline should never be used near an open fire, or lamp,
as explosions and deaths result from the flame being led
through the gasoline-saturated air to the vessel containing
it.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>A cigar box and a bottle with a notched cork may be
used for holding specimens. Cigar boxes may be used for
holding collections of dried insects. Cork or ribbed
packing paper may be fixed in the bottom for supporting
the insect pins. Moth balls or tobacco may be placed
in each box to keep out the insect pests which infest collections.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captured insects which, in either the larval or the perfect
stage, are injurious to vegetation, should always be
killed after studying their actions and external features,
even if the internal structure is not to be studied. Beneficial
insects, such as ladybugs, ichneumon flies, bees,
mantis (devil’s horse), dragon flies, etc., should be set
free uninjured.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Anatomy and General Characteristics of the Class Insecta</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>The <b>body</b> of an insect is divided by means of two marked
narrowings into three parts: the head, the chest, and the
abdomen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>head</b> is a freely movable capsule
bearing four pairs of appendages.
Hence it is regarded as
having been formed by the union
of four rings, since the <i>ancestor of
the insects</i> is believed to have consisted
of similar rings, each ring
bearing a pair of unspecialized legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The typical <b>mouth parts</b> of an
insect (Fig. <a href='#fig_123'>123</a>) named in order
from above, are (1) an upper lip (labrum, <i>ol</i>), (2) a pair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of biting jaws (mandibles, <i>ok</i>), (3) a pair of grasping
jaws (maxillæ, <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>), and (4) a lower lip (labium, <i>m</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>).
The grasping jaws bear two pairs of
jointed jaw fingers (maxillary palpi,
<i>D</i>, <i>C</i>), and the lower lip bears a pair
of similar lip fingers (labial palpi, <i>d</i>).
The biting jaws move sideways; they
usually have several pointed notches
which serve as teeth. Why should the
grasping jaws be beneath the chewing
jaws? Why is it better for the lower
lip to have fingers than the upper lip?
Why are the fingers (or palpi)
jointed? (Watch a grasshopper
or beetle eating.) Why does an
insect need grasping jaws?</p>

them, since no other adult animals have that
number, the spider having eight, the crayfish
and crabs having ten, the centipedes still more, while
birds and beasts have less than six. Hence the insects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>are sometimes called the Six-Footed class (<i>Hexapoda</i>).
The insects are the only animals that have the <b>body</b> in
<b>three divisions</b>. Man, beasts, and birds have only two
divisions (head and trunk). Worms are not divided.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Define</b> the class <i>insecta</i> by the two facts characteristic of
them (<i>i.e.</i> possessed by them alone), viz.: Insects are animals
with ———— and ————. Why would it be ambiguous
to include “hard outer skeleton” in this definition? To
include “bilateral symmetry”? “Segmented body”? The
definition of a class must <i>include</i> all the individuals of the class,
and <i>exclude</i> all the animals that do not belong to the class.</p>

<p class='c017'>The leg of an insect (Fig. <a href='#fig_125'>125</a>) has five joints (two short
joints, two long, and the foot). Named in order from above, they
are (1) the hip (coxa), (2) thigh ring (trochanter), (3) thigh
(femur), (4) the shin (tibia), (5) the foot, which
has five parts. Which of the five joints of a
wasp’s leg (Fig. <a href='#fig_161'>161</a>) is thickest? Slenderest?
Shortest? One joint (which?) of the foot
(Fig. <a href='#fig_161'>161</a>) is about as long as the other four
joints of the foot combined. Is the relative
length of the joints of the leg the same in
grasshoppers, beetles, etc., as in the wasp (Figs.)? Figure 125 is
a diagram of an insect’s leg cut lengthwise. The leg consists of
thick-walled tubes (<i>o</i>, <i>n</i>) with their ends held together by thin,
easy-wrinkling membranes which serve as joints. Thus motion is
provided for at the expense of strength. When handling live
insects they should never be held by the legs, as the legs come
off very easily. Does the joint motion of insects most resemble
the motion of hinge joints or ball-and-socket joints? Answer by
tests of living insects. There are no muscles in the foot of an
insect. The claw is moved by a muscle (<i>m</i>) in the thigh with which
it is connected by the long tendon (<i>z</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>v</i>). In which part are
the breathing muscles? As the wings are developed from folds
of the dorsal skin, the wing has two layers, an upper and a lower
layer. These inclose the so-called “nerves” or ribs of the wing,
each of which consists of a blood tube inclosed in an air tube.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The <b>abdomen</b> in various species consists of from five
to eleven overlapping rings with their fold-like joints between

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 128.</span>—<span class='sc'>Air Tubes of Insect.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The <b>food tube</b> (Fig. <a href='#fig_127'>127</a>) begins at the mouth, which
usually bears salivary glands (4, Fig. <a href='#fig_127'>127</a>, which represents
internal organs of the grasshopper). The food tube
expands first into a <i>croplike</i> enlargement; next to this
is an organ (6, Fig. <a href='#fig_127'>127</a>), which resembles the gizzard
in birds, as its inner wall is furnished with chitinous teeth
(<i>b</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_114'>114</a>). These reduce the food fragments that were
imperfectly broken up by the biting jaws before swallowing.
<i>Glands</i> comparable to the liver of higher animals
open into the food tube where the stomach joins the small
intestine. At the junction of the small and the large intestine
(9) are a number of <i>fine tubes</i> (8) which correspond to
<i>kidneys</i> and empty their secretion into the large intestine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>breathing organs</b> of the insects are peculiar to
them (see Fig. <a href='#fig_128'>128</a>). They consist of tubes which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>kept open by having in their walls continuous spirals of
horny material called <i>chitin</i>. Most noticeable are the
two large membranous tubes filled with air and
situated on each side of the body. Do these
tubes extend through the thorax? (Fig. <a href='#fig_128'>128</a>.) The
air reaches these two main tubes by a number
of pairs of short windpipes, or <i>tracheas</i>, which
begin at openings (<i>spiracles</i>). In which division
are the spiracles most numerous? (Fig. <a href='#fig_128'>128</a>.)
Which division is
without spiracles?
Could an insect
be drowned, <i>i.e.</i>
smothered, by holding its
body under water? Could
it be drowned by immersing
all of it but its head? The
motion of the air through
the breathing tubes is caused by a bellowslike <i>motion of the
abdomen</i>. This is readily observed in grasshoppers, beetles,
and wasps. As each ring slips into the ring in front of it,
the abdomen is shortened, and the impure air, laden with
carbon dioxide, is forced out. As the rings slip out, the
abdomen is extended
and the fresh air comes
in, bringing oxygen.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The  Circulation.</b>—Near
the dorsal surface
of the abdomen (Fig.
<a href='#fig_131'>131</a>) extends the long, slender <i>heart</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_129'>129</a>). The heart
has divisions separated by valvelike partitions. The blood
comes into each of the heart compartments through a pair
of openings. The heart contracts from the rear toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the front, driving the blood forward. The blood contains
bodies corresponding to the <i>white corpuscles</i> of human
blood, but lacks the red corpuscles and the red colour. The
blood is sent even to the wings. The veins in the wings
consist of horny tubes inclosing air tubes surrounded
by blood spaces, and the purification of the blood
takes place throughout the course
of the circulation. Hence the imperfect
circulation is no disadvantage.
The perfect provision for
supplying oxygen explains the
remarkable activity of which insects
are capable and their great
strength, which, considering their
size, is unequalled by any other
animals.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Nervous System.</b>—The
heart in backboned animals, <i>e.g.</i>
man, is ventral and the chief nerve trunk is dorsal. As
already stated, the heart of an insect is dorsal; its chief
nerve chain, consisting of a <i>double row of ganglia</i>, is near
the ventral surface (Fig. <a href='#fig_131'>131</a>). All the ganglia are below
the food tube except the first pair in the head, which are
above the gullet. This pair may be said to
correspond somewhat to the brain of backboned
animals; the nerves from the eyes and the feelers
lead to it. With social insects, as bees and
ants, it is large and complex (Fig. <a href='#fig_132'>132</a>). In a
typical insect they are the largest ganglia.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Senses.</b>—The sense of <i>smell</i> of most insects
is believed to be located in the feelers.
The organ of <i>hearing</i> is variously located in different insects.
Where is it in the grasshopper? The organs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><i>sight</i> are highly developed, and consist of two compound
eyes on the side of the head and three simple eyes on the
top or front of the head between the compound
eyes. The simple eye has nerve
cells, pigments, and a lens resembling
the lens in the eyes of vertebrates (Fig.
<a href='#fig_134'>134</a>). The compound eye (Fig. <a href='#fig_135'>135</a>) has
thousands of facets, usually hexagonal,
on its surface, the facets being the outer
ends of cones which have their inner
ends directed toward the centre of the
eye. It is probable that the large, or
compound, eyes of insects only serve to distinguish bright
objects from dark objects. The simple eyes afford distinct
images of objects within a
few inches of the eye. In general,
the sight of insects, contrary
to what its complex sight organs
would lead us to expect, is not at
all keen. Yet an insect can fly
through a forest without striking
a twig or branch. Is it better for
the eyes that are immovable in
the head to be large or small?
Which has comparatively larger
eyes, an insect or a beast?</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Inherited Habit, or Instinct.</b>—Insects and other animals
inherit from their parents their particular form of
body and of organs which perform the different functions.
For example, they inherit a nervous system with a structure
similar to that of their parents, and hence with a tendency
to repeat similar impulses and acts. Repeated acts
constitute a habit, and <i>an inherited habit is called an instinct</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Moths, for example, are used to finding nectar in
the night-blooming flowers, most of which are white. The
habit of going to white flowers is transmitted in the structure
of the nervous system; so we say that moths have
an instinct to go to white objects; it is sometimes more
obscurely expressed by saying they are attracted or drawn
thereby.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Instincts are not Infallible.</b>—They are trustworthy in
only one narrow set of conditions. Now that man makes
many fires and lights at night, the instinct just mentioned
often causes the death of the moth. The instinct to
provide for offspring is necessary to the perpetuation of
all but the simplest animals. The dirt dauber, or mud
wasp, because of inherited habit, or instinct, makes the
cell of the right size, lays the egg, and provides food for
offspring that the mother will never see. It seals stung
and semiparalyzed spiders in the cell with the egg. If
you try the experiment of removing the food before the
cell is closed, the insect will bring more spiders; if they
are removed again, a third supply will be brought; but if
taken out the third time, the mud wasp will usually close
the cell without food, and when the egg hatches the grub
will starve.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Development of Insects.</b>—The growth and the moulting
of the grasshopper from egg to adult has been studied.
All insects do not develop exactly by this plan. Some
hatch from the egg in a condition markedly different from
the adult. The butterfly’s egg produces a wormlike caterpillar
which has no resemblance to the butterfly. After
it grows it forms an inclosing case in which it spends a
quiet period of development and comes out a butterfly.
This change from caterpillar to butterfly is called the
<i>metamorphosis</i>. The life of an insect is divided into four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>stages: (1) <i>egg</i>, (2) <i>larva</i>, (3) <i>pupa</i>, and (4) <i>imago</i>, or perfect
insect (Figs. <a href='#fig_136'>136</a>, <a href='#fig_137'>137</a>, <a href='#fig_138'>138</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The egg stage is one of development, no nourishment
being absorbed. The larval stage is one of voracious feeding
and rapid growth. In the pupa
stage no food is taken and there is
no growth in size, but rapid development
takes place. In the perfect
stage food is eaten, but no
growth in size takes place. In this
stage the eggs are produced. When
there is very little resemblance between
the larva and the imago, and no pupal stage,
the metamorphosis, or change, is said to be
<i>complete</i>. When, as with the grasshopper, no
very marked change takes place between the
larva and the imago, there being no pupal
stage, the metamorphosis is said to be incomplete.
By studying the illustrations and
specimens, and by thinking of your past observations of
insects, determine which of the insects in the following list
have a complete metamorphosis: beetle, house fly, grasshopper,
butterfly, cricket, wasp.</p>

<p class='c011'>A single pair of wings is characteristic of the order <span class='sc'>Diptera</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Horny sheath-like fore wings, covering the hind wings and
meeting in a straight line down the middle of the back, will distinguish
the order <span class='sc'>Coleoptera</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hind wings folded like a fan beneath the thickened and overlapping

<span class='sc'>Orthoptera</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The possession of a sting (in females) and of two pairs of thin
membranous wings—the small hind wing hooked to the rear margin
of the fore wing—will distinguish the common <span class='sc'>Hymenoptera</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides these, there remain a number of groups most of which
have in the past been included under the order <span class='sc'>Neuroptera</span>,
among which the Mayflies will be readily recognized by the lack
of mouth parts and by the possession of two or three long tails;
the dragon flies by the two pairs of large wings, enormous eyes, and
minute bristle-like antennæ; the scorpion flies, by the possession
of a rigid beak, with the mouth parts at its tip; the caddis flies,
by their hairy wings and lack of jaws; the lace wings, by the
exquisite regularity of the series of cross veins about the margin
of their wings, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Moths and Butterflies.</b>—Order ____? Why ____ (p. <a href='#Page_82'>82</a>)?</p>

<p class='c011'>The presence of scales on the wings is a never-failing
test of a moth or a butterfly. The wings do not fold at all.
They are so large and the legs so weak and delicate
that the butterfly keeps its balance with difficulty when
walking in the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>The maxillæ are developed to form the long sucking
proboscis. How do they fit together to form a tube?
(See Fig. <a href='#fig_147'>147</a>.) The proboscis varies from a fraction of an
inch in the “miller” to five inches in some tropical moths,
which use it to extract nectar from long tubular flowers.
When not in use, it is held coiled like a watch spring under
the head (Fig. <a href='#fig_148'>148</a>). The upper lip (labrum), under lip
(labium), and lip fingers (labial palpi) are very small, and
the mandibles small or wanting (Fig. <a href='#fig_146'>146</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The metamorphosis is complete, the contrast between
the caterpillar or larva of the moth and the butterfly and
the adult form being very great. The caterpillar has the
three pairs of jointed legs typical of insects; these are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>found near the head (Fig. <a href='#fig_141'>141</a>). It has also from three
to five pairs of fleshy unjointed prolegs, one pair of
which is always on the last segment. How many pairs
of prolegs has the silkworm caterpillar? (Fig. <a href='#fig_143'>143</a>.)
The measuring worm, or looper? (Fig. <a href='#fig_136'>136</a>.) The pupa
has a thin shell. Can you see external signs of the
antennæ, wings, and legs in this stage? (Fig. <a href='#fig_143'>143</a>.) The
pupa is concealed by protective coloration and is sometimes
inclosed in a silken cocoon which was spun by the
caterpillar before the last moult. Hairy caterpillars are
uncomfortable for birds to eat. The naked and brightly
marked ones (examples of warning coloration) often contain
an acrid and distasteful fluid. The injuries from
lepidoptera are done in the caterpillar stage. The codling
moth (Fig. <a href='#fig_141'>141</a>) destroys apples to the estimated value of
$6,000,000 annually. The clothes moth (Fig. <a href='#fig_171'>171</a>) is a
household pest. The tent caterpillar denudes trees of their
leaves. The only useful caterpillar is the silkworm (Fig.
<a href='#fig_143'>143</a>). In Italy and Japan many of the country dwellings
have silk rooms where thousands of these caterpillars are
fed and tended by women and children. Why is the cabbage
butterfly so called? Why can it not eat cabbage?
Why does sealing clothes in a paper bag prevent the
ravages of the clothes moth?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Flight of Lepidoptera.</b>—Which appears to use more exertion
to keep afloat, a bird or a butterfly? Explain why.
Of all flying insects which would more probably be found
highest up mountains? How does the butterfly suddenly
change direction of flight? Does it usually fly in a straight
or a zigzag course? Advantage of this? Bright colours are
protective, as lepidoptera are in greatest danger when at
rest on flowers. Are the brightest colours on upper or
under side of wings of butterfly? Why? (Think of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>colours in a flower.) Why is it better for moths to hold
their wings flat out when at rest? Where are moths during
the day? How can you test whether the colour of the
wings is given by the scales?</p>

<p class='c011'>State <b>how moths and butterflies differ</b> in respect to:
body, wings, feelers, habits.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Insects and Flowers.</b>—Perhaps we are indebted to insects
for the bright colours and sweet honey of flowers.
Flowers need insects to carry their pollen to other flowers,
as cross-fertilization produces the best seeds. The insects
need the nectar of the flowers for food, and the bright
colours and sweet odours are the advertisements of the
flowers to attract insects. Flowers of brightest hues are
the ones that receive the visits of insects. Moths, butterflies,
and bees carry most pollen (see Beginners’ Botany,
Chap. VI).</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Illustrated Study of Spiders</b> (Figs. <a href='#fig_178'>178</a>–183).—The tarantula, like most spiders,
has eight simple eyes (none compound). Find them (Fig. <a href='#fig_178'>178</a>). How do
spiders and insects differ in body? Number of legs? Which have more joints to
legs? Does trap-door spider hold the door closed (Fig. <a href='#fig_179'>179</a>)? How many pairs
of spinnerets for spinning web has a spider (<i>Spw</i>, 180)? Foot of spider has how
many claws? How many combs on claws for holding web? Spiders spin a
cocoon for holding eggs. From what part of abdomen are eggs laid (<i>E</i>, 182;
2, 181)? Find spider’s air sacs, <i>lu</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_181'>181</a>; spinning organs, <i>sp</i>; fang, <i>kf</i>; poison

is not an insect. How does it place its feet at each step (Fig. <a href='#fig_110'>110</a>)? Does the
size of its nerve ganglia indicate great or little intelligence? Why do you think
first part of body corresponds to both head and thorax of insects?</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>The Fresh-water Mussel</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—The mussel is usually easy to procure from
streams and lakes by raking or dredging. In cities the hard-shelled
clam, or quahog, is for sale at the markets, and the following
descriptions apply to the anodon, unio, or quahog, with
slight changes in regard to the siphons. Mussels can be kept
alive for a long time in a tub with sand in the bottom. Pairs of
shells should be at hand for study.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>External Features.</b>—The shell is an elongated oval,
broader and blunter at one end (Fig. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>). Why does
the animal close its shell? Does it open the shell?
Why? Does it thrust the foot forward and pull up to it,
or thrust the foot back and push? (Mussels and clams
have no bones.) Does it go with the blunt end or the more
tapering end of the shell forward? (Fig. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>.) Can a
mussel swim? Why, or why not?</p>

<p class='c011'>Lay the shells, fitted together, in your hand with <i>the hinge
side away from you and the blunt end to the left</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>).
Is the right or the left shell
uppermost? Which is the
top, or dorsal, side? Which
is the front, or anterior,
end? Is the straight edge
at the top or at the bottom?
Our word “valve” is derived
from a word meaning shell,
because the Romans used
shells for valves in pumps. Is the mussel a univalve or a
bivalve? Which kind is the oyster? The snail?</p>

<p class='c011'>Does the mussel have <i>bilateral symmetry</i>? Can you
find a <i>horny covering</i>, or epidermis, over the limy shell
of a fresh specimen? Why is it necessary? Does water
dissolve lime? Horn? Find a bare spot. Does any of
the shell appear to be missing there?</p>

<p class='c011'>The bare projection on each shell is called the <i>umbo</i>.
Is the umbo near the ventral or the dorsal line? The
posterior or anterior end? Is
the surface of the umbones
worn? Do the umbones rub
against the sand as the mussel
ploughs its way along? How are
the shells held together? Where
is the <i>ligament</i> attached? (Fig.
<a href='#fig_189'>189</a>.) Is it opposite the umbones
or more to the front or
to the rear? (Fig. <a href='#fig_189'>189</a>.) Is the ligament
of the same material as the shell? Is the ligament
in a compressed condition when the shell is open or when
it is closed? (Fig. <a href='#fig_189'>189</a>.) When is the muscle relaxed?</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 190.</span>—<span class='sc'>Mussel</span> crawling in sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Notice the <i>lines</i> on the outside of the shell (Figs. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>
and <a href='#fig_190'>190</a>). What point do they surround? They are <i>lines
of growth</i>. Was each line once the
margin of the shell? If the shell
should increase in size, what would
the present margin become? (Fig.
<a href='#fig_191'>191</a>.) Does growth take place on
the margin only? Did the shell
grow thicker as it grew larger?
Where is it thinnest?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Draw</b> the outside of the shell from
the side. Draw a dorsal view. Near the drawings write the
names of the margins of the shell (p. <a href='#Page_98'>98</a>) and of other parts
learned, using lines to indicate the location of the parts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Study the surface of the shell inside and out. The
inside is called <i>mother-of-pearl</i>. Is it of lime? Is the
deeper layer of the shell of lime? (When weak hydrochloric
acid or strong vinegar is dropped on limy substances,
a gas, carbon dioxide, bubbles up.) Compare the thickness
of the <i>epidermal layer</i>, the middle <i>chalky layer</i>, and the
inner, <i>pearly layer</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Anatomy of the Mussel.</b>—What parts protrude at any
time beyond the edge of the shell? (Fig. <a href='#fig_190'>190</a>.) The shell
is secreted by two folds of the outer
layer of the soft body of the mussel.
These large, flaplike folds hang
down on each side, and are called
the mantle. The two great flaps
of the <i>mantle</i> hang down lower than
the rest of the body and line the
shell which it secretes (Fig. <a href='#fig_192'>192</a>).
The epidermis of the mantle secretes the shell just as the
epidermis of the crayfish secretes its crust. Can you find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>the pallial line, or the line to which the mantle extended
on each shell when the animal was alive? A free portion
of the mantle extended like a fringe below the pallial line.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The shells were held together by
two large <i>adductor muscles</i>. The
anterior adductor (Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>) is near
the front end, above the foot. The
posterior adductor is toward the rear
end, but not so near the end as the
anterior. Can you find both <i>muscle
scars</i> in the shells? Are they nearer
the ventral or the dorsal surface?
The points of attachment travelled
downward and farther apart as the
animal grew (see Fig. <a href='#fig_191'>191</a>). Higher
than the larger scars are small scars, or impressions, where
the protractor and retractor muscles that extend and draw
in the foot were attached.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 193.</span>—<span class='sc'>Anatomy of Mussel.</span> (Beddard.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The muscular <i>foot</i> extends downward in the middle, halfway
between the shells (Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>). On each side of the
foot and behind
it hang down
the two pairs of
<b>gills</b>, the outer
pair and the inner
pair (Fig.
<a href='#fig_192'>192</a>). They may
be compared to
four V-shaped
troughs with
their sides full of holes. The water enters the troughs
through the holes and overflows above. Is there a marked
difference in the size of the two pairs of gills? A kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>chamber for the gills is made by the joining of the mantle
flaps below, along the ventral line. The mantle edges are
separated at two places, leaving openings called <i>exhalent</i>
and <i>inhalent siphons</i>.</p>

<div id='fig_194'  class='figleft id161'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Fresh water with its oxygen, propelled by <i>cilia</i> at the
opening and on the gills, enters through the lower or
inhalent siphon, passes between the gills, and goes to an
upper passage, leaving the gill chamber by a slit which
separates the gills from the foot.
For this passage, see arrow
(Fig. <a href='#fig_194'>194</a>). The movement of
the water is opposite to the way
the arrow points. After going
upward and backward, the water
emerges by the exhalent siphon.
The gills originally consisted of
a great number of filaments.
These are now united, but not
completely so, and the gills still
have a perforated or lattice
structure. Thus they present a
large surface for absorbing oxygen
from the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>mouth</b> is in front of the foot, between it and the
anterior adductor muscle (Fig. <a href='#fig_194'>194</a>). On each side of the
mouth are the <i>labial palps</i>, which are lateral lips (Fig. <a href='#fig_195'>195</a>).
They have cilia which convey the food to the mouth after
the inhalent siphon has sent food beyond the gill chamber
and near to the mouth. Thus both food and oxygen enter
at the inhalent siphon. The foot is in the position of a
lower lip, and if regarded as a greatly extended lower lip,
the animal may be said to have what is to us the absurd
habit of using its lower lip as a foot. The foot is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>said to be hatchet-shaped (Fig. <a href='#fig_195'>195</a>). Do you see
any resemblance? Does the foot penetrate deep or shallow
into the sand? (Fig. <a href='#fig_190'>190</a>.) Why,
or why not?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The <b>food tube</b> of the mussel is comparatively
simple. Behind the mouth it
enlarges into a swelling called the <i>stomach</i>
(Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>). The bile ducts of the
neighbouring liver empty into the stomach.
The <i>intestine</i> makes several turns in the
substance of the upper part of the foot
and then passing upward, it runs approximately
straight to the vent (or anus),
which is in the wall of the exhalent
siphon. The intestine not only runs
through the <i>pericardial cavity</i> (celome)
surrounding the heart, but through the
ventricle of the heart itself (Fig. <a href='#fig_196'>196</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The <b>kidneys</b> consist of tubes which
open into the pericardial chamber above
and into the gill chamber below (<i>Neph.</i>,
Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>). The tubes are surrounded by
numerous blood vessels (Fig. <a href='#fig_198'>198</a>) and
carry off the waste matter from the blood.</p>

<div id='fig_197'  class='figright id065'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 197.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The <b>nervous system</b> consists of <i>three
pairs of ganglia</i> and nerves (Fig. <a href='#fig_197'>197</a>).
The ganglia are distinguishable because of
their orange colour. The pedal
ganglia on the front of the foot
are easily seen also; the visceral
ganglia on the posterior
adductor muscle may be seen
without removing the mussel
from the shell (Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>). The reproductive organs
open into the rear portion of the gill cavity (Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>).
The sperms, having been set free in the water, are drawn into
the ova by the same current that brings the food. The eggs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>are hatched in the gills. After a while the young mussels go out
through the siphon.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Summary.</b>—In the gills (Fig. <a href='#fig_198'>198</a>) the blood gains what?
Loses what? From the digestive tube the blood absorbs nourishment.
In the kidneys the blood is partly purified by the loss of
nitrogenous waste.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The cilia of the fringes on the inhalent, or lower, siphon,
vibrate continually and drive water and food particles into
the mouth cavity. Food particles that are brought near the
labial palps are conveyed by them
to the mouth. As the water passes
along the perforated gills, its oxygen
is absorbed; the mantle also absorbs
oxygen from the water as it passes.
The water, as stated before, goes
next through a passage between the
foot and the palp into the cavity above
the gills and on out through the
exhalent siphon. By stirring the
water, or placing a drop of ink near
the siphons of a mussel kept in a tub,
the direction of its flow may be seen.
The pulsations of the heart are
plainly visible in a living mollusc.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Habits of the Mussel.</b>—Is it abundant in clear or in muddy
water; swift, still, or slightly moving water? Describe
its track or furrow. What is its rate of travel? Can you
distinguish the spots where the foot was attached to the
ground? How long is one “step” compared to the length
of the shell? The animal usually has the valves opened
that it may breathe and eat. The hinge ligament acts like
the case spring of a watch, and holds the valves open unless
the adductor muscles draw them together (Fig. <a href='#fig_189'>189</a>).</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>When the mussel first hatches from the egg, it has a triangular
shell. It soon attaches itself to some fish and thus
travels about. After two months it
drops to the bottom again.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Other Mollusca.</b>—The <i>oyster’s</i> shells
are not an exact pair, the shell which
lies upon the bottom being hollowed
out to contain the body, and the upper
shell being flat. Can you tell by examining
an oyster shell which was the
lower valve? Does it show signs of
having been attached to the bottom?
The young oyster, like the young mussel,
is free-swimming. Like the arthropoda, most molluscs
undergo a metamorphosis to reach
the adult stage (Fig. <a href='#fig_199'>199</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Examine the shells of clams,
snails, scallops, and cockles. Make
drawings of their shells. The slug
is very similar to the snail except
that it has no shell. If the shell of the snail shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig_202'>202</a> were removed, there would be left a very good
representation of a slug.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Economic Importance of
Mollusca.</b>—Several species
of clams are eaten. One of
them is the <i>hardshell clam</i>
(quahog) found on the Atlantic
coast from Cape Cod
to Texas. Its shell is white. It often burrows slightly
beneath the surface. The <i>softshell clam</i> is better liked as
food. It lives along the shores of all northern seas. It
burrows a foot beneath the surface and extends its siphons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>through the burrow to the surface when the tide is in,
and draws into its shell the water containing animalcules
and oxygen.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Oysters</i> to the value of many millions of dollars are gathered
and sold every year. The most valuable oyster fisheries
of North America are in Chesapeake Bay. The
young oysters, or “spat,” after they attach themselves to
the bottom in shallow water, are transplanted. New oyster
beds are formed in this way. The beds are sometimes
strewn with pieces of rock, broken pottery, etc., to encourage
the oysters to attach themselves. The dark spot in the
fleshy body of the oyster is the digestive gland, or liver.
The cut ends of the tough adductor muscles are noticeable
in raw oysters. The starfish is very destructive in oyster
beds.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Study of a Live
Snail or Slug.</b>—Is
its body dry or
moist? Do land
snails and slugs have lungs or gills? Why? How many pairs
of tentacles have they? What is their relative length and position?
The eyes are dark spots at bases of tentacles of snail and at the
tips of the rear tentacles of slug. Touch the tentacles. What
happens? Do the tentacles simply stretch, or do they turn inside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>out as they are extended? Is the respiratory opening on the
right or the left side of the body? On the mantle fold or on the body?
(Figs. <a href='#fig_202'>202</a>–3–4.) How
often does the aperture
open and close?</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Cephalopods.</b>—The
highest and best developed
molluscs are
the <b>cephalopods</b>, or “head-footed” molluscs. Surrounding the
mouth are eight or ten appendages which serve both as feet and
as arms. These appendages have two rows of sucking disks by
which the animal attaches itself to the sea bottom, or seizes fish
or other prey with a firm grip. The commonest examples are the
<i>squid</i>, with a long body and ten
arms, and the <i>octopus</i>, or devilfish,
with a short body and
eight arms. Cephalopods have
strong biting mouth parts and
complex eyes somewhat resembling
the eyes of backboned,
or vertebrate, animals. The
large and staring eyes add to the uncanny, terrifying appearance.</p>

(Fig. <a href='#fig_205'>205</a>). The

a fish with
motion so slow as to be

<p class='c011'><b>General Questions.</b>—The living parts of the mussel are
very soft, the name mollusca being derived from the
Latin word <i>mollis</i>, soft. Why is it that the softest animals,
the molluscs, have the hardest coverings?</p>

<p class='c011'>To which class of molluscs is the name acephala (headless)
appropriate? Lamellibranchiata (platelike gills)?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Why is a smooth shell suited to a clam and a rough
shell suited to an oyster? Why are the turns of a snail’s
shell so small near the centre?</p>

<p class='c011'>Why does the mussel have no use for head, eyes, or projecting
feelers? In what position of the valves of a mussel
is the hinge ligament in a stretched condition? How does
the shape of the mussel’s gills insure that the water current
and the blood current are brought in close contact?</p>

<p class='c011'>The three main classes of molluscs are: the pelecypoda
(hatchet-footed); gastropoda (stomach-footed); and cephalopoda
(head-footed). Give an example of each class.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—The
behaviour of a
live fish in clear
water, preferably in
a glass vessel or an
aquarium, should be
studied. A skeleton may be
prepared by placing a fish in
the reach of ants. Skeletons
of animals placed on ant beds
are cleaned very thoroughly.
The study of the perch, that follows, will apply to almost any other
common fish.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Movements and External Features.</b>—What is the <i>general
shape of the body</i> of a fish? How does the dorsal, or
upper, region differ in form from the ventral? Is there a
narrow part or neck where the head joins the trunk?
Where is the body thickest? What is the ratio between
the length and the height? (Fig. <a href='#fig_209'>209</a>.) Are the right and
the left sides alike? Is the symmetry of the fish bilateral
or radial?</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>body of the fish may be divided</i> into three regions—the
head, the trunk, and the tail. The trunk begins with the
foremost scales; the tail is said to begin at the vent, or
anus. Which regions bear appendages? Is the head
movable independently of the trunk, or do they move
together? State the advantage or the disadvantage in this.
Is the body depressed (flattened vertically) or compressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>(flattened laterally)? Do both forms occur among fishes?
(See figures on pages <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>, <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>How is the <i>shape of the body advantageous for movement</i>?
Can a fish turn more readily from side to side, or
up and down? Why? Is the head wedge-shaped or conical?
Are the jaws flattened laterally or vertically? The
fish swims in the water, the bird swims in the air. Account
for the differences in the shape of their bodies.</p>

<div id='fig_209'  class='figcenter id173'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 209.</span>—<span class='sc'>White Perch</span> (<i>Morone Americana</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Is the <i>covering of the body</i> like the covering of any animal
yet studied? The scales are attached in little pockets,
or folds, in the skin. Observe the shape and size of scales
on different parts of the body. What parts of the fish are
without scales? Examine a single scale; what is its
shape? Do you see concentric lines of growth on a scale?
Sketch a few of the scales to show their arrangement.
What is the use of scales? Why are no scales needed on
the head? How much of each scale is hidden? Is there
a film over the scale? Are the colours in the scale or
on it?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Fins.</b>—Are the movements of the fish active or
sluggish? Can it remain stationary without using its fins?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Can it move backward? How are the fins set in motion?
What is the colour of the flesh, or muscles, of a fish? Count
the fins. How many are in pairs? (Fig. <a href='#fig_209'>209</a>.) How many
are vertical? How many are on the side? How many
are on the middle line? Are the paired or the unpaired fins
more effective in balancing the fish? In turning it from
side to side? In raising and lowering the fish? In propelling
it forward? How are some of the fins useful to
the fish besides for balancing and swimming?</p>

<p class='c011'>The hard <i>spines</i> supporting the fins are called the fin
rays. The fin on the dorsal line of the fish is called the
<i>dorsal</i> fin. Are its rays larger or smaller than the rays of
the other fins? The perch is sometimes said to have two
dorsal fins, since it is divided into two parts. The fin
forming the tail is called the tail fin, or <i>caudal</i> fin. Are
its upper and its lower corners alike in all fishes? (Fig. <a href='#fig_228'>228</a>.)
On the ventral side, just behind the vent, is the ventral
fin, also called the anal fin. The three fins mentioned are
unpaired fins. Of the four-paired fins, the pair higher on
the sides (and usually nearer the front) are the <i>pectoral</i>
fins. The pair nearer the ventral line are the <i>pelvic</i> fins.
They are close together, and in many fish are joined
across the ventral line. The ventral fins are compared to
the legs, and the pectoral fins to the arms, of higher vertebrates.
(Fig. <a href='#fig_244'>244</a>.) Compare fins of fish, pages <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>, <a href='#Page_124'>124</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Make a <b>drawing</b> of the fish seen from the side, omitting
the scales unless your drawing is very large.</p>

<p class='c011'>Are the <b>eyes</b> on the top or on the sides of the head, or on
both? Can a fish shut its eyes? Why, or why not? Is the eyeball
bare, or covered by a membrane? Is the covering of
the eyeball continuous with the skin of the head? Is
there a fold or wrinkle in this membrane or the surrounding
skin? Has the eye a pupil? An iris? Is the eye of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the fish immovable, slightly movable, or freely movable?
Can it look with both eyes at the same object? Is the
<i>range of vision</i> more upward or downward? To the front
or the side? In
what direction is
vision impossible?
Can a fish close its
eyes in sleep? Does
the eyeball appear
spherical or flattened
in front?
The ball is really
spherical, the lens is very convex, and fish are nearsighted.
Far sight would be useless in a dense medium like water.
In what direction from the eyes are the <b>nostrils</b> (Fig.
<a href='#fig_211'>211</a>.) There are two pair of nostrils, but there is only one
pair of nasal cavities, with two nostrils opening into each.
There are no nasal passages to
the mouth, as the test with a
probe shows that the cavities do
not open into the mouth. What
two functions has the nose in man?
What function has it in the fish?</p>

<p class='c011'>There are <i>no external</i> <b>ears</b>.
The ear sacs are embedded in the
bones of the skull. Is hearing acute or dull? When you are
fishing, is it more necessary not to talk or to step lightly,
so as not to jar the boat or bank?</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>What is the use of the large openings found at the back
of the head on each side? (Fig. <a href='#fig_211'>211</a>.) Under the skin at
the sides of the head are thin membrane bones formed from
the skin; they aid the skin in protection. Just under these
membrane bones are the gill covers, of true bone. Which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>consists of more parts, the membranous layer, or the true
bony layer in the gill cover? (Figs. <a href='#fig_211'>211</a> and <a href='#fig_212'>212</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Is the <b>mouth</b> large or small? Are the <i>teeth</i> blunt or
pointed? Near the outer edge, or far in the mouth?
(Fig. <a href='#fig_212'>212</a>.) Does the fish have lips? Are the teeth in
one continuous row in either jaw? In the upper jaw
there are also teeth on the premaxillary bones. These
bones are in front of the maxillary bones, which are without
teeth. Teeth are also found in the roof of the mouth,
and the tongue bears horny appendages similar to teeth.
Are the teeth of the fish better suited for chewing or for
grasping? Why are teeth on the tongue useful? Watch
a fish eating: does it chew its food? Can a fish taste?
Test by placing bits of brown paper and food in a vessel
or jar containing a live fish. Is the throat, or gullet, of the
fish large or small?</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>skeleton</b> of a fish is simpler than the skeleton of
other backboned animals. Study Fig. <a href='#fig_212'>212</a> or a prepared
skeleton. At first glance, the skeleton appears to have
two vertebral columns. Why? What bones does the fish
have that correspond to bones in the human skeleton?
Are the projections (processes) from the vertebræ long or
short? The <i>ribs</i> are attached to the vertebræ of the trunk,
the last rib being above the vent. The tail begins at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>vent. Are there more tail vertebræ or trunk vertebræ?
Are there any neck (cervical) vertebræ (<i>i.e.</i> in front of
those that bear ribs)? The first few ribs (how many?) are
attached to the central body of the vertebræ. The remaining
ribs are loosely attached to processes on the
vertebræ. The ribs of bony fishes are not homologous
with the ribs of the higher vertebrates. In most fishes
there are bones called intermuscular bones attached to the
first ribs (how many in the perch?) which are possibly homologous
to true ribs; that is, true ribs in the higher vertebrates
may have been developed from such beginnings.</p>

Which kind are
stiff, and which are

<p class='c011'>The <b>gills</b> are at the sides of the head (Fig. <a href='#fig_215'>215</a>) under
the opercula, or gill covers. What is the colour of the gills?
Do the blood vessels appear to be
very near the surface of the gills, or
away from the surface? What advantage
in this? Are the gills smooth
or wrinkled? (Fig. <a href='#fig_215'>215</a>.) What advantage?
The bony supports of the
gills, called the gill arches, are shown
in Fig. <a href='#fig_216'>216</a> (<i>k<sub>1</sub></i> to <i>k<sub>4</sub></i>). How many
arches on each side? The gill arches have projections
on their front sides, called gill rakers, to prevent food
from being washed
through the clefts
between the arches.
The fringes on the
rear of the gill
arches are called
the gill filaments (<i>a</i>,
Fig. <a href='#fig_216'>216</a>). These
filaments support
the thin and much-wrinkled
borders of
the gills, for the
gills are constructed
on the plan of exposing the greatest possible surface to
the water. Compare the plan of the gills and that of the
human lungs. The gill opening on each side is guarded by
seven rays (<i>kh</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_216'>216</a>) along the hinder border of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>gill cover. These rays grow from the tongue bone. (<i>Zu</i>,

between the gills. Is the mouth opened and closed in the
act of breathing? Are the openings behind
the gill covers opened and closed? How
many times per minute does fresh water reach
the gills? Do the mouth and the gill covers
open at the same time? Why must the water
in contact with the gills be changed constantly? Why
does a fish usually rest with its
head up stream? How may a
fish be kept alive for a time
after it is removed from the
water? Why does drying of
the gills prevent breathing? If
the mouth of a fish were propped open, and the fish returned
to the water, would it suffocate? Why, or why not?</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Food Tube.</b>—The gullet is short and wide. The stomach is
elongated (Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>). There is a slight constriction, or narrowing,
where it joins the intestine. Is the intestine straight, or does
it lie in few or in many loops? (Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>.) The liver has a gall
bladder and empties into the intestine through a bile duct. Is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>liver large or small? Simple or lobed? The spleen (<i>mi</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>)
lies in a loop of the intestine. The last part of the intestine is
straight and is called the rectum. Is it of the same size as the
other portions of the intestine? The fish does not possess a pancreas,
the most important digestive gland of higher vertebrates.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The <i>ovary</i> lies between the intestine and the air bladder. In Fig.
<a href='#fig_220'>220</a> it is shown enlarged and filled with egg masses called roe. It
opens by a pore behind the vent. The silver lining of the body cavity
is called the peritoneum.</p>

<p class='c017'>Is the <i>air bladder</i> in the perch simple or partly divided? In the
carp? (Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>.) Is it above or below the centre of the body? Why?
The air bladder makes the body of the fish about as light as water
that it may rise and sink with little effort. When a fish dies, the gases
of decomposition distend the bladder and the abdomen, and the fish
turns over. Why?</p>

<p class='c017'>Where are the <i>kidneys</i>? (Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>.) Their ends unite close under
the spinal column. The ureters, or tubes, leading from them, unite,
and after passing a small urinary bladder, lead to a tiny urinary pore
just behind the opening from the ovary. (Coloured figure 4.)</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Circulation.</b>—The fish, unlike other vertebrates, has its
breathing organs and its heart in its head. The gills have already
been described. The heart of an air-breathing vertebrate is near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>its lungs. Why? The <i>heart</i> of a fish is near its gills for the same
reason. The heart has one auricle and one ventricle. (Coloured
figure 1.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Blood returning to the heart comes through several veins into a
<i>sinus</i>, or antechamber, whence it passes down through a valve
into the <i>auricle</i>; from the auricle it goes forward into the <i>ventricle</i>.
The ventricle sends it into an <i>artery</i>, not directly, but through a
<i>bulb</i> (<i>as</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_220'>220</a>), which serves to maintain
a steady flow, without pulse beats, into the
large artery (<i>aorta</i>) leading to the gills. The
arteries leading from the gills join to form a
<i>dorsal aorta</i> (<i>Ao</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_221'>221</a>), which passes
backward, inclosed by the lower processes of
the spinal column. After going through the
<i>capillaries</i> of the various organs, the blood
returns to the heart through veins.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <i>colour of the blood</i> is given by red
corpuscles. These are nucleated, oval, and
larger than the blood corpuscles of other vertebrates.
The blood of the fish is slightly
above the temperature of the water it inhabits.</p>

<p class='c017'>Notice the general shape of the brain
(Fig. <a href='#fig_222'>222</a>). Are its subdivisions distinct or
indistinct? Are the lobes in pairs? The
middle portion of the brain is the widest,
and consists of the two <i>optic lobes</i>. From these lobes the optic
nerves pass beneath the brain to the eyes (<i>Sn</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_223'>223</a>). In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>front of the optic lobes lie the two cerebral lobes, or the <i>cerebrum</i>.
The small <i>olfactory lobes</i> are seen (Fig. <a href='#fig_224'>224</a>) in front of the cerebrum.
The olfactory nerves may be traced to the nostrils. Behind
the optic lobes (mid brain) is the cerebellum (hind brain) and
behind it is the <i>medulla oblongata</i>
or beginning of the spinal cord.</p>

Which is the most important sense?</p>

<p class='c017'>The scales along a certain line on each side of the fish, called

<p class='c011'><b>Reproduction.</b>—The female fish deposits the unfertilized
eggs, or ova, in a secluded spot on the bottom. Afterward
the male fish deposits the sperms in the same place (see
Fig. <a href='#fig_225'>225</a>). The eggs, thus unprotected, and newly hatched
fish as well, are used for food by fish of the same and other
species. To compensate for this great destruction, most
fish lay (spawn) many thousands of eggs, very few of
which reach maturity. Higher vertebrates (<i>e.g.</i> birds) have,
by their superior intelligence,
risen above
this wasteful method
of reproduction. Some
kinds of marine fish,
notably cod, herring,
and salmon, go many
miles up fresh rivers
to spawn. It is possible that this is because they were
originally fresh-water species; yet they die if placed in
fresh water except during the spawning season. They go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>because of <i>instinct</i>, which is simply an inherited habit.
Rivers may be safer than the ocean for their young. They
are worn and exhausted by the journey, and never survive
to lay eggs the second time.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>air bladder is developed from the food tube</i> in the

vertebrates. Are their functions the same?</p>

<p class='c011'>Fish that <i>feed on flesh have a short intestine</i>. Those
that eat plants have a long intestine. Which kind of food
is more quickly digested?</p>

<p class='c011'>There are <i>mucous glands in the skin</i> of a fish which
supply a secretion to facilitate movement through the
water; hence a freshly caught fish, before the secretion
has dried, feels very slippery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The air bladder, although homologous to lungs, is not a
breathing organ in common fishes. It is filled by the
formation of gases from the blood, and can be made
smaller by the contraction of muscles along the sides of
the body; this causes the fish to sink. In the gar and
other ganoids, the air bladder contains blood vessels, is connected
with the gullet, and is used in breathing. Organs
<i>serving the same purpose</i> in different animals are said to be
<i>analogous</i>. To what in man are the gills of the fish analogous?
Organs having <i>a like position and origin</i> are
said to be <i>homologous</i>. The air bladders of a fish are
homologous with the lungs of man; but since they have
not the same use they are not analogous.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>How does the tail of a shark or a gar differ from the
tail of common fishes? (Fig. <a href='#fig_228'>228</a>.) Do you know of fish

</div>

<p class='c010'>The theory of evolution teaches that animal life began in a very
simple form in the sea, and that afterward the higher sea animals
lost their gills and developed lungs and legs and came out to live
upon the land; truly a marvellous procedure, and incredible to
many, although the process is repeated every spring in countless
instances in pond and brook.</p>

<p class='c011'>In popular language, every cold-blooded vertebrate breathing
with lungs is called a reptile. The name reptile is properly
applied only to lizards, snakes, turtles, and alligators. The common
mistake of speaking of frogs and salamanders as reptiles
arises from considering them only in their adult condition. Reptiles
hatch from the egg as tiny reptiles resembling the adult
forms; frogs and salamanders, as every one knows, leave the egg
in the form of tadpoles (Fig. <a href='#fig_248'>248</a>). The fact that frogs and
salamanders begin active life as fishes, breathing by gills, serves to
distinguish them from other cold-blooded animals, and causes
naturalists to place them in a separate class, called batrachia
(twice breather) or amphibia (double life).</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Tadpoles</span></h3>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—Tadpoles may be studied by placing a number
of frog’s eggs in a jar of water, care being taken not to place
a large number of eggs in a small amount of water. When they
hatch, water plants (<i>e.g.</i> green algæ) should be added for food.
The behaviour of frogs may be best studied in a tub of water. A
toad in captivity should be given a cool, moist place, and fed well.
A piece of meat placed near a toad may attract flies, and the toad
may be observed while catching them, but the motion is so swift
as to be almost imperceptible. Live flies may be put into a glass
jar with a toad. Toads do not move about until twilight, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in cloudy, wet weather. They return to ponds and brooks in
spring at the time for laying eggs. This time for both frogs and
toads is shown by trilling. All frogs, except tree frogs, remain in
or near the water all the year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do <b>eggs hatch</b> and tadpoles grow more rapidly in a
jar of water kept in a warm place or in a cold place?
In pond water or in drinking water? Can the tadpoles be
seen to move in the eggs before hatching? When do

<p class='c011'>What <b>parts</b> may be described in a tadpole? What is
the shape of the tail? <i>Compare the tadpole with the fish</i>
as to (1) general
shape, (2) covering,
(3) fins, (4)

<p class='c011'>Do the external
<b>gills</b> disappear
before or after any rudiments of limbs appear?
(6, 7, Fig. <a href='#fig_248'>248</a>.) Can you locate the gills after they become
internal? (Fig. <a href='#fig_249'>249</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In what state of growth are the <i>legs</i> when the tadpole
first goes to the surface to breathe? Which legs appear
first? Of what advantage is this? What becomes of the
tail? Is the tail entirely gone before the frog first leaves
the water? Are tadpoles habitually in motion or at
rest?</p>

<p class='c011'>Is the <b>intestine</b> visible through the skin? (Fig. <a href='#fig_249'>249</a>.)
Is it straight or coiled? Remembering why some fish
have larger intestines than others, and that a cow has a
long intestine and a cat a short one, state why a tadpole
has a relatively longer intestine than a frog.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Compare</b> the mouth, jaws, eyes, skin, body, and habits
of <i>tadpole and frog</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><span class='sc'>Frogs</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>Prove that frogs and toads are <i>beneficial to man</i>. Did
you ever know of a frog or a toad destroying anything
useful, or harming any one, or causing warts? How
many pupils in class ever had warts? Had they handled
frogs before the warts came? Frogs are interesting,
gentle, timid animals. Why are they repulsive to some
people?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Environment</b>.—<i>Where are frogs found</i> in greatest
numbers? What occurs when danger threatens them?
What <i>enemies</i> do they have? What colour, or tint, is most
prominent on a frog? Does the colour “mimic” or <i>imitate</i>
its surroundings? What is the colour of the under
side of the body? (Fig. <a href='#fig_250'>250</a>.) Why is there greater
safety in that colour? What enemies would see water frogs
from below? Do tree frogs mimic the bark? The
leaves?</p>

<p class='c011'>Can a <i>frog stay under water</i> for an indefinite time?
Why, or why not? What part of a frog is above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>surface when it floats or swims in a tub of water? Why?
Do frogs croak in the water or on the bank? Why do
they croak after a rain? Do toads croak?</p>

<p class='c011'>Are the <i>eggs</i> laid in still or in flowing water? In a clear
place or among sticks and stems? Singly, or in strings or
in masses? (Fig. <a href='#fig_248'>248</a>.) Describe an egg. Why do frogs
dig into the mud in autumn in cold climates? Why do

<p class='c011'>Describe the <b>position</b> of the frog when still (Fig. <a href='#fig_250'>250</a>).
Of what advantage in this position? Does the frog use
its fore legs in swimming or jumping? Its hind legs?
How is the frog fitted for jumping? Compare it in this
respect with a jumping insect; a jumping mammal. How
is it fitted for swimming? Is the general build of its body
better fitted for swimming or for jumping? How far can a
frog jump?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>External Features.</b>—The frog may be said to have two
<i>regions in its body</i>, the head and the trunk. A neck hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>exists, as there is only one vertebra in front of the shoulders
(Fig. <a href='#fig_252'>252</a>), while mammals have seven neck (cervical)
vertebræ. There are no tail (caudal) vertebræ, even in the
tadpole state of frogs and toads.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>head</i> appears triangular in shape when viewed from
what direction? The head of a frog is more pointed than
the head of a toad. Is the skull a closed case of broad
bones or an open structure of narrow bones? (Fig. <a href='#fig_252'>252</a>.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Describe the <i>mouth.</i> Observe the extent of the mouth
opening (Fig. <a href='#fig_251'>251</a>). Are <i>teeth</i> present in the upper jaw?
The lower jaw? Are the teeth sharp or dull? Does the
frog chew its food? Is the <i>tongue</i>
slender or thick? (Fig. <a href='#fig_251'>251</a>.) Is
it attached to the front or the back
of the mouth? In what direction
does the free end extend when the
tongue lies flat? Is the end pointed
or lobed? How far out will the
tongue stretch? For what is it
used? Why is it better for the teeth to be in the upper
jaw rather than in the lower jaw? That the teeth are of
little service is shown by the fact that the toad with similar
habits of eating has no teeth. Will a toad catch and
swallow a bullet or a pebble rolled before it? The toad is
accustomed to living food, hence it prefers a moving
insect to a still one.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Senses.</b>—Compare the <i>eyes</i> with the eyes of a
fish in respect to position and parts. Are the eyes protruding
or deep-set? Touch the eye of a live frog. Can
it be retracted? What is the shape of the pupil? The
colour of the iris? Is the eye bright or dull? What probably
gave rise to the superstition that a toad had a
jewel in its head? Is there a third eyelid? Are the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>upper and lower eyelids of the same thickness? With
which lid does it wink? Close its eye?</p>

<p class='c011'>Observe the large oval <i>ear</i> drum or tympanum. What
is its direction from the eye? (Fig. <a href='#fig_251'>251</a>.) The mouth?
Is there a projecting ear? Does the frog hear well?
What reason for your answer? As in the human ear, a
tube (the Eustachian tube) leads from the mouth to the
inner side of the tympanum.</p>

<p class='c011'>How many <i>nostrils</i>? (Fig. <a href='#fig_251'>251</a>.) Are they near together
or separated? Large or small? A bristle passed
into the nostril comes into the mouth not far back in the
roof. Why must it differ from a fish in this?</p>

<p class='c011'>How do the <i>fore and hind legs</i> differ? How many toes
on the fore foot or hand? On the hind foot? On which
foot is one of the toes rudimentary? Why is the fore limb
of no assistance in propelling the body in jumping? Do
the toes turn in or out? (Fig. <a href='#fig_250'>250</a>.) How does the frog
give direction to the
jump? What would
be the disadvantage
of always jumping
straight forward
when fleeing? Which
legs are more useful
in alighting?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Divisions of the
Limbs</b>.—Distinguish
the upper arm, forearm,
and hand in the
fore limb (Figs. <a href='#fig_252'>252</a> and <a href='#fig_253'>253</a>). <i>Compare with skeleton of
man</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig_399'>399</a>). Do the arms of a man and a frog both
have one bone in the <i>upper arm</i> and two in the <i>forearm</i>?
Both have several closely joined bones in the <i>wrist</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>five separate bones in the <i>palm</i>. Do any of the frog’s
fingers have three joints? <i>Compare also the leg of man</i>
and the hind leg
of the frog (Figs.
<a href='#fig_253'>253</a> and <a href='#fig_399'>399</a>). Does
the <i>thigh</i> have one
bone in each? The
shank of man has
two bones, shin and
splint bone. Do
you see a groove
near the end in the
shank bone of a
frog (Fig. <a href='#fig_252'>252</a>), indicating
that it
was formed by the
union of a shin and
a splint bone? The
first two of the five bones of the ankle are elongated, giving
the hind leg the appearance of
having an extra joint (Fig. <a href='#fig_253'>253</a>). The
foot consists of six digits, one of which,
like the thumb on the fore limb, is
rudimentary. The five developed toes
give the five digits of the typical vertebrate
foot. Besides the five bones corresponding
to the instep, the toes have
two, three, or four bones each. How
is the hind foot specialized for swimming?
Which joint of the leg contains
most muscle? (Fig. <a href='#fig_254'>254</a>.) Find other bones of the

<p class='c011'>All batrachians have large and <i>numerous blood vessels
in the skin</i> by which gases are exchanged with the air,
the skin being almost equal to <i>a third lung</i>. That the
skin may function in this way, it
must not become dry. Using this
fact, account for certain habits of
toads as well as frogs.</p>

<p class='c011'>If a frog is kept in the dark or
on a dark surface, <i>its skin will become
darker</i> than if kept in the light
or on a white dish. Try this experiment,
comparing two frogs. This
power of changing colour is believed
to be due to the diminution in size
of certain pigment cells by contraction,
and enlargement from relaxation.
This power is possessed to a certain
degree not only by batrachians but
also by many fishes and reptiles.
The chameleon, or green lizard,
surpasses all other animals in this
respect (Fig. <a href='#fig_280'>280</a>). What advantage
from this power?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Digestive System.</b>—The large mouth cavity is connected
by a short throat with the gullet, or œsophagus (Fig. <a href='#fig_255'>255</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>A slit called the glottis opens from the throat into the
lungs (Fig. <a href='#fig_255'>255</a>). Is the gullet long or short? Broad
or narrow? Is the stomach short or elongated? Is the
division distinct between stomach and gullet, and
stomach and intestine? Is the liver large or small? Is
it simple or lobed? The pancreas lies between the
stomach and the first bend of the intestines (Fig. <a href='#fig_255'>255</a>).
What is its shape? A bile duct connects the liver with
the small intestine (<i>Dc</i>, Fig.
<a href='#fig_255'>255</a>). It passes through the
pancreas, from which it receives
several  pancreatic
ducts. After many turns, the
small intestine joins the large
intestine. The last part of
the large intestine is called
the rectum (Latin, straight).
The last part of the rectum is
called the cloaca (Latin, a
drain), and into it the ducts
from the kidneys and the reproductive
glands also open.
The kidneys are large, elongated,
and flat. They lie under
the dorsal wall. The urinary bladder is also large. Does
the salamander have a similar digestive system? (Fig. <a href='#fig_256'>256</a>)
Why are the liver and the lungs (Fig. <a href='#fig_256'>256</a>) longer in a
salamander than in a frog?</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><b>Respiration.</b>—How many <i>lungs</i>? Are they simple
or lobed? (Fig. <a href='#fig_256'>256</a>.) A lung cut open is seen to be
baglike, with numerous ridges on its inner surface.
This increases the surface with which the air may come
in contact. In the walls of the lungs are numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>capillaries. Does the frog <i>breathe with mouth open or
closed</i>? Does the frog have any ribs for expanding the
chest? What part of the head expands and contracts?
Is this motion repeated at a slow or a rapid rate? Regularly
or irregularly? There are valves in the nostrils for
opening and closing them. Is there any indication of
opening and closing as the throat expands and contracts?
The mouth and throat (pharynx) are filled with air each
time the throat swells, and the exchange of gases (which
gases?) takes place continually through their walls and
the walls of the lungs. At intervals the air is forced
through the glottis into the lungs. After a short time
it is expelled from the lungs by the muscular abdominal
walls, which press upon the abdominal organs, and so
upon the lungs. Immediately the air is forced back
into the lungs, so that they are kept filled. In some
species the lungs regularly expand at every second contraction
of the throat. This is shown by a slight outward
motion at the sides. Does the motion of the throat
cease when the frog is under water? Why would the
frog be unable to breathe (except through the skin) if its
mouth were propped open? Why does the fact that the
breathing is so slow as almost to cease during hibernation,
aid the frog in going through the winter without
starving? (Chap. I.) Why must frogs and toads keep their
skins moist? Which looks more like a clod? Why?</p>

<p class='c017'><b>The Heart and Circulation.</b>—What is the shape of the heart?
(Fig. <a href='#fig_257'>257</a>.) Observe the two auricles in front and the conical
ventricle behind them. The great arterial trunk from the ventricle
passes forward beyond the auricles; it divides into two branches
which turn to the right and the left (Fig. <a href='#fig_257'>257</a>). Each branch immediately
subdivides into three arteries (Fig. <a href='#fig_257'>257</a>), one going to
the head, one to the lungs and skin, and a third, the largest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>passes backward in the trunk, where it is united again to its
fellow.</p>

<p class='c017'>Both the pulmonary veins, returning to the heart with pure

the auricles empty into the ventricles,
but the pure and the impure
blood are prevented from thoroughly
mixing by ridges on the inside of the
ventricle. Only in an animal with
a four-chambered heart does pure
blood from the lungs pass unmixed
and pure to all parts of the body,
and only such animals are warm-blooded. The purer (<i>i.e.</i> the more
oxygenated) the blood, the greater the oxidation and warmth.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Frogs and toads are beneficial</b> (why?) and do not the slightest
injury to any interest of man. If <b>toads</b> are encouraged
to take up their abode in a garden, they will aid in ridding
it of insects. A house may be made in a shady corner with
four bricks, or better still, a hole a foot deep may be dug to
furnish them protection from
the heat of the day. A toad’s
muzzle is not so tapering as a
frog’s (why?), its feet are not
so fully webbed (why?), and its
skin is not so smooth (why?).
In case of doubt, open the
mouth and rub the finger along
the upper jaw; a frog has sharp
teeth, a toad none at all. The tadpoles of frogs, toads, and
salamanders are much alike. In toad’s spawn the eggs lie in
strings inclosed in jelly; frogs spawn is in masses (Fig. <a href='#fig_248'>248</a>).</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Any batrachian may easily be passed around the class after placing
it in a tumbler with gauze or net tied over top. It should be kept in a
box with two inches of moist earth on the bottom. If no live insects
are obtainable for feeding a toad, bits of moist meat may be dangled
from the end of a string. If tadpoles are placed in a pool or a tub in a
garden, the toads hatched will soon make destructive garden insects
become a rarity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Does a frog or a <b>salamander</b> have the more primitive
form of body? Why do you think so? Salamanders are
sometimes called mud puppies. The absurd belief that
salamanders are poisonous is to be classed with the belief
that toads cause warts. The belief among the ancients
that salamanders ate fire arose perhaps from seeing them
coming away from fires that had been built over their
holes on river banks by travellers. Their moist skin protected
them until the fire became very hot.</p>

<p class='c011'>Describe the “mud puppy” shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_262'>262</a>. The
pouched gopher, or rat (Fig. <a href='#fig_371'>371</a>), is sometimes absurdly

an elongated body, two pairs of limbs, and a long tail, yet
they are easily distinguished. Are the differences suggested
above valid for the other batrachians (frogs) and

largely of wide <i>ribs</i>
(how many?) much flattened
and grown together
at their edges. The ribs
are seen to be rigidly attached
to the vertebræ.
The rear projections of
the vertebræ are flattened
into a series of bony plates
which take the place of
the sharp ridge found
along the backs of most
vertebrates. Show that the shell
of a turtle is not homologous with

<p class='c011'><b>Tortoise, Turtle, Terrapin.</b>—The
turtles belong to the order of reptiles
called <i>chelonians</i>. No one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>can have any difficulty in knowing a member of this order.
The subdivision of the order into families is not so easy,
however, and the popular attempts to classify chelonians
as turtles, tortoises, and terrapins have not been entirely
successful. Species with a vaulted shell and imperfectly
webbed toes and <i>strictly terrestrial</i> habits are called <i>tortoises</i>.
Species with flattened shells and <i>strictly aquatic</i>
habits should be called <i>terrapins</i> (<i>e.g.</i> mud terrapin). They
have three instead of two joints in the middle toe of each
foot. The term <i>turtle</i> may be applied to species which are
<i>partly terrestrial and partly aquatic</i> (<i>e.g.</i> snapping turtle
(Fig. <a href='#fig_271'>271</a>)). Usage, however, is by no means uniform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most reptiles eat animal food; green terrapins and some
land tortoises eat vegetable food. Would you judge that
carnivorous chelonians catch very active prey?</p>

<p class='c011'>The fierce <i>snapping turtle</i>, found in ponds and streams,
sometimes has a body three feet long. Its head and tail
are very large and cannot be withdrawn into the shell.
It is carnivorous and has great strength of jaw. It has
been known to snap a large stick in two. The <i>box tortoise</i>
is yellowish brown with blotches of yellow, and like its
close kinsman, the pond turtle of Europe (Fig. <a href='#fig_266'>266</a>), withdraws
itself and closes its shell completely. Both lids of the
plastron are movable, a peculiarity belonging to these two
species. The <i>giant tortoise</i> of the Galapagos Islands, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to Lyddeker, can trot cheerfully along with three
full-grown men on its back. “Tortoise shell” used for
combs and other articles is obtained from the overlapping
scales of the <i>hawkbill turtle</i>, common in the West Indies.
The <i>diamond-back terrapin</i>, found along the Atlantic Coast
from Massachusetts to Texas, is prized for making soup.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Protective Coloration and Mimicry.</b>—When an animal
imitates the colour or form of its <i>inanimate surroundings</i> it
is said to be <i>protectively
coloured</i> or formed. Give
an instance of <i>protective
Coloration</i> or <i>form</i> among
lizards; butterflies;
grasshoppers; amphibians;
echinoderms.
When an animal imitates the colour or the form of
<i>another animal</i> it is said to <i>mimic</i> the animal. Mimicry
usually enables an animal to deceive
enemies into mistaking it for an animal
which for some reason they avoid.
The milkweed butterfly has a taste
that is repulsive to birds. The viceroy
butterfly is palatable to birds, but
it is left untouched because of its
close resemblance to the repulsive
milkweed butterfly. The harlequin
snake (<i>Elaps</i>) of the Gulf states is the
most deadly snake of North America
(Figs. <a href='#fig_277'>277</a>, <a href='#fig_278'>278</a>). It is very strikingly coloured with rings of
scarlet, yellow, and black. This is an example of <i>warning</i>
coloration. The scarlet snake (<i>Lampropeltis</i>) has bands of
scarlet, yellow, and black (coloured Fig. <a href='#fig_006'>6</a>) of the same tints,
and it is hardly distinguishable from the harlequin. The
scarlet snake is said to <i>mimic</i> the harlequin snake. It also
imitates the quiet inoffensive habits
of the harlequin snake, which
fortunately does not strike except
under the greatest provocation.
The rattles of the less poisonous
but deadly rattlesnake (Fig.
<a href='#fig_272'>272</a>) may be classed as an
example of <i>warning sound</i> which
most animals are quick to heed
and thus avoid encounters which
might be destructive to either the
snake or its enemy.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Survival of the Fittest.</b>—The two
facts of most far-reaching importance
in the history of animals and plants
are: (1) <i>Heredity</i>; animals inherit
the characteristics of their parents.
(2) <i>Variation</i>; animals are not exactly
like their parents. The first
fact gives stability, the second makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>evolution possible. The climate of the world is slowly changing,
and animals must change to adapt themselves to it. A more
sudden change of environment (surroundings) of animals occurs
because of migration or isolation; these in turn are caused
by the crowding of
other animals or by
the formation or disappearance
of geographical
barriers,
such as deserts, water,
mountain chains.</p>

<p class='c017'>The young vary in
many ways from their
parents. Some have
a more protective
colour or form, sharper
claws, swifter movements, etc. The individuals possessing such beneficial
variations live longer and leave more offspring, and because
of heredity transmit the desirable qualities to
some of their young. Variations which are disadvantageous
for getting food, defence, etc., cause
shorter life and fewer offspring. Thus the <i>fittest
survive</i>, the unfit perish; an automatic <i>natural

<p class='c017'>Darwin taught that variations are infinitesimal
and gradual. Recent experiments and observations
seem to show that many variations are by
sudden jumps, somewhat resembling so-called
“freaks of nature.” As to whether these “sports,”
or individuals with new peculiarities, survive,
depends upon their fitness for their environment.
“Survival of the fittest” results from this
natural selection, but the selection occurs between
animals of marked, not infinitesimal, differences,
as Darwin taught. Darwin’s theory is
probably true for species in the usual state of nature; the new
theory (of De Vries) is probably true for animals and plants under
domestication and during rapid geographical changes.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—The domestic pigeon, the fowl, and the English
sparrow are most commonly within the reach of students. The
last bird has become a pest and is almost the only bird whose
destruction is desirable. The female is somewhat uniformly mottled
with gray and brown in fine markings. The male has a black
throat with the other markings of black, brown, and white, in
stronger contrast than the marking of the female. As the different
species of birds are essentially alike in structural features, the directions
and questions may be used with any bird at hand. When
studying feathers, one or more should be provided for each pupil
in the class. The feet and the bills of birds should be kept for study.</p>

<p class='c011'>Does the <b>body of the bird</b> like the toad and the turtle,
have a head, a trunk, a tail, and two
pairs of limbs? Do the fore and
hind limbs differ from each other more or
less than the limbs of other backboned
animals? Does any other vertebrate use
them for purposes as widely different?</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Eye.</b>—Does the <i>eyeball</i> have parts corresponding
to the eyeball of a fish or a frog; viz., cornea, iris, pupil?
Which is more movable, the upper or the lower <i>eyelid</i>? <i>Are</i>
there any lashes? The bird (like what other animal?) has
a third eyelid, or nictitating membrane. Compare its
thickness with that of the other lids. Is it drawn over
the eyeball from the inner or the outer corner of the eye?
Can you see in the human eye any wrinkle or growth

The outside of the beak seems to be of what kind

a dissected bird, and find
if there is a covering on
the bill which can be cut
or scraped off. Is the
mass of the bill of bony
or horny material? With
what part of the human
head are the mandibles
homologous? (Fig. <a href='#fig_284'>284</a>.)</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Ears.</b>—Do birds have
external ears? Is there an <i>external opening</i> leading to the
ear? In searching for it, blow or push forward the feathers.
If found, notice its location, size, shape, and what
surrounds the opening. There is an owl spoken of as the
long-eared owl. Are its ears long?</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>leg</b> has three divisions: the uppermost is the <i>thigh</i>
(called the “second joint” in a fowl); the middle division
is the <i>shank</i> (or “drumstick”); and the lowest, which is
the slender bone covered with scales, is formed by the
union of the <i>ankle</i> and the <i>instep</i>. (The bones of the three
divisions are named femur, tibiotarsus, and tarsometatarsus.)
The <i>foot</i> consists entirely of toes, the bones of
which are called phalanges. Is there a bone in each claw?
(See Fig. <a href='#fig_285'>285</a>.) Supply the numerals in this sentence:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The pigeon has ____ toes, the

joints (Fig. <a href='#fig_285'>285</a>).
Is the thigh of a bird bare or
feathered? The shin? The
ankle? Where is the ankle
joint of a bird? Do
you see the remains
of another bone (the
splint bone, or fibula)
on the shin bone of
the shank? (Fig. <a href='#fig_285'>285</a>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The <i>thigh</i> hardly projects beyond the skin of the trunk,
as may be noticed in a plucked fowl. The thigh extends
forward from the hip joint (Figs. <a href='#fig_286'>286</a>, <a href='#fig_299'>299</a>) in order to bring
the point of support forward under the centre of weight.
Why are long front toes more necessary than long hind toes?
As the bird must often bring its head to the ground, the
hip joints are near the dorsal surface and the body swings
between the two points of support somewhat like a silver
ice pitcher on its two pivots. Hence stooping, which makes
a man so unsteady, does not cause a bird to lose steadiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>wing</b> has three divisions which correspond to the

When the wing is folded, the three divisions lie close

The similarity of the bones of the first and second divisions
to the bones of our upper <i>arm</i> and <i>forearm</i> is very obvious
(Fig. <a href='#fig_286'>286</a>). Explain.
The <i>hand</i> of
a bird is furnished
with only three digits
(Fig. <a href='#fig_287'>287</a>). The
three palm bones
(metacarpals) are
firmly united (Fig.
<a href='#fig_287'>287</a>). This gives
firmness to the
stroke in flying.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>That the bird is
<i>descended from animals</i>
which had the
fingers and palm bones less firmly united is shown by
comparing the hands of a <i>chick</i> and of an <i>adult</i> fowl
(Figs. <a href='#fig_287'>287</a>, <a href='#fig_288'>288</a>). The wrist also solidifies with age, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>five carpals of the chick being reduced to two in the fowl
(Figs. <a href='#fig_287'>287</a>, <a href='#fig_288'>288</a>). The thumb or first digit has a covering
of skin separate from that of the other
digits, as may be seen in a plucked bird.
The degenerate hand of the fowl is of
course useless as a hand (what serves
in its place?) but it is well fitted for
firm support of the feathers in flying. The
two bones of the forearm are also firmly
joined. There are eighteen movable
joints in our arm and hand. The bird
has only the three joints which enable
it to fold its wing. The wrist joint is
the joint in the forward angle of the wing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since the fore limbs are taken up with locomotion,
the <b>grasping function</b> has been assumed
by the <i>jaws</i>. How does their
shape adapt them to this use? For
the same reason the <i>neck</i> of a bird
surpasses the necks of all other animals
in what respect? Is the trunk
of a bird
flexible or
inflexible?
There is
thus a <i>correlation</i>
between structure
of neck and trunk.
Explain.  The same
correlation is found in
which of the reptiles?
(Why does rigidity of
trunk require flexibility
of neck?) Why does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the length of neck in birds correlate with the length of
legs? Examples? (See Figs. <a href='#fig_314'>314</a>, <a href='#fig_315'>315</a>, <a href='#fig_332'>332</a>.) Exceptions?
(Fig. <a href='#fig_324'>324</a>.) Why does a swan or a goose have a long

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To make a firm support for the wings the vertebræ of
the back are immovably joined, also there are three bones
in each shoulder, the collar bone,
the shoulder blade, and the
coracoid bone (Fig. <a href='#fig_286'>286</a>). The
collar bones are united (why?)
and form the “wishbone” or
“pulling bone.” To furnish surface
for the attachment of the
large flying muscles there is a
prominent ridge or keel on the
breastbone (Fig. <a href='#fig_286'>286</a>). It is
lacking in most birds which do
not fly (Fig. <a href='#fig_289'>289</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>feathers</b> are perhaps the
most characteristic feature of
birds. The large feathers of the
wings and tail are called <i>quill
feathers</i>. A quill feather (Fig.
<a href='#fig_291'>291</a>) is seen to consist of two
parts, the <i>shaft</i>, or supporting
axis, and the broad <i>vane</i> or web.
What part of the shaft is round? Hollow? Solid? Is
the shaft straight? Are the sides of the vane usually
equal in width? Can you tell by looking at a quill whether
it belongs to the wing or the tail, and which wing or which
side of the tail it comes from? Do the quills overlap
with the wide side of the vane above or beneath the next
feather? Can you cause two parts of the vane to unite again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>by pressing together the two sides of a split in the vane?
Does the web separate at the same place when pulled until
it splits again?</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The hollow part of the
shaft of a quill feather is
called the <i>quill</i>. The part
of the shaft bearing the
vane is called the <i>rachis</i>
(rā-kis). The vane consists
of slender <i>barbs</i> which are
branches of the shaft (II,
Fig. <a href='#fig_292'>292</a>). As the name
indicates (see dictionary), a
barb resembles a hair. The
barbs in turn bear secondary
branches called <i>barbules</i>,
and these again have
shorter branches called <i>barbicels</i>
(III, Fig. <a href='#fig_292'>292</a>). These are sometimes bent in the
form of hooklets (Fig. <a href='#fig_292'>292</a>, III), and the hooklets of
neighbouring barbules interlock, giving
firmness to the vane. When two
barbules are split apart, and then reunited
by stroking the vane between
the thumb and the finger, the union
may be so strong that a pull upon
the vane will cause it to split in a
new place next time.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 293.—A Down Feather</span>, enlarged.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are <b>four kinds</b> of feathers,
(1) the <i>quill</i> feathers, just studied;
(2) the <i>contour</i> feathers (I, Fig. <a href='#fig_292'>292</a>),
which form the general surface of the body and give it its
outlines; (3) the <i>downy</i> feathers (Fig. <a href='#fig_293'>293</a>), abundant on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>nestlings and found among the contour feathers of the
adult but not showing on the surface; (4) the <i>pin</i> feathers,
which are hair-like, and which are removed from a plucked
bird by singeing. The contour feathers are similar in
structure to the quill feathers. They protect the body
from blows, overlap so as to shed the rain, and, with the
aid of the downy feathers, retain the heat, thus accounting
for the high temperature of the bird. The downy feathers
are soft and fluffy, as they possess few or no barbicels;
sometimes they lack the rachis (Fig. <a href='#fig_293'>293</a>). The pin feathers
are delicate horny shafts, greatly resembling hairs, but
they may have a tuft of barbs at the ends.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A <b>feather grows</b> from a small projection (or papilla) found
at the bottom of a depression of the skin. The quill is
formed by being moulded around the papilla. Do you see
any opening at the tip of the quill for blood vessels to enter
and nourish the feather? What is in the quill? (Fig. <a href='#fig_291'>291</a>.)
The rachis? A young contour
or quill feather is inclosed
in a delicate sheath
which is cast off when the
feather has been formed.
Have you seen the sheath
incasing a young feather in
a moulting bird?</p>

<p class='c011'>There are considerable
<b>areas</b> or tracts on a bird’s
skin <b>without contour feathers</b>.
Such bare tracts are
found along the ridge of the breast and on the sides of
the neck. However, the contour feathers lie so as to overlap
and cover the whole body perfectly (Fig. <a href='#fig_294'>294</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The shedding of the feathers is called <b>moulting</b>. Feathers,
like the leaves of trees, are delicate structures and lose
perfect condition with age. Hence the annual renewal
of the feathers is
an advantage. Most
birds shed twice a
year, and with many
the summer plumage
is brighter coloured
than the winter
plumage. When
a feather is shed on
one side, the corresponding
feather on
the other side is
always shed with it. (What need for this?) A large
<i>oil gland</i> is easily found on the
dorsal side of the tail. How does
the bird apply the oil to the
feathers?</p>

see a bird sitting on a swinging
limb? What was its chief means
of balancing itself? When flying,
what does a bird do to direct its
course upward? Downward? Is
the body level when it turns to
either side? Birds with long,
pointed wings excel in what respect? Examples? Birds
with great wing surface excel in what kind of flight? Examples.
Name a common bird with short wings which
has a laboured, whirring flight. Is its tail large or small?
Does it avoid obstacles and direct its
flight well? Why or why not? When
a boat is to be turned to the right,
must the rudder be pulled to the right
or to the left? (The rudder drags in
the water and thus pulls the boat
around.) When the bird wishes to
go upward, must its tail be turned up
or down? How when it wishes to go
down? When a buzzard soars for an hour without flapping
its wings, does it move at a uniform rate? For what does
it use the momentum gained when going with the wind?</p>

the wing this side of the vane is pressed by the air against
the feather above it and the air cannot pass through the
wing. As the wing is raised the vanes separate and
the air passes through. The convex upper surface of
the wing also prevents the wing from catching air as
it is raised. Spread a wing and blow strongly against

</div>

<p class='c011'><b>The Internal Organs, or Viscera</b> (Figs. <a href='#fig_304'>304</a> and <a href='#fig_305'>305</a>).—The
viscera (vis’se-ra), as in most vertebrates, <i>include</i>
the food tube and its glands; the lungs, the heart, and the
larger blood vessels; the kidneys and bladder and the
reproductive organs. The lower part, or gullet, is enlarged
into a <i>crop</i>. It is largest in grain-eating birds. It
is found in the V-shaped depression at the angle of the
wishbone, just before the food tube enters the thorax.
The food is stored and softened in the crop. From the
crop the food passes at intervals into the glandular stomach.
Close to this is the muscular stomach, or gizzard. Are the
places of entrance and exit on opposite sides of the gizzard,
or near together? (Fig. <a href='#fig_304'>304</a>.) Is the lining of the gizzard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>rough or smooth? Why? Is the gizzard tough or weak?
Why are small stones in the gizzard? Why do not hawks
and other birds of prey need a muscular gizzard? The
liver and pancreas empty their secretions into the intestines
by several ducts a little way beyond the gizzard. Beyond
the mouths of two cæca (Fig. <a href='#fig_305'>305</a>) the many-coiled
intestine empties into the straight
rectum, which terminates in a
widened part called the cloaca.
Not only the intestine, but the
two ureters of the urinary system
and the two genital ducts of the
reproductive system all empty into
the cloaca (Figs. <a href='#fig_304'>304</a>, <a href='#fig_305'>305</a>).</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>lungs</b> have their rear surfaces
attached to the spinal
column and ribs (<i>lu</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_304'>304</a>).
They are connected with thin-walled,
transparent <i>air sacs</i> which
aid in purifying the blood. When
inflated with warm air, they probably
make the body of the bird
more buoyant. For the names,
location, and shape of several
pairs of air sacs, see Fig. <a href='#fig_306'>306</a>.
The connection of the air sacs with
hollows in the humerus bones is also shown in the figure.
Many of the <i>bones are hollow</i>; this adds to the buoyancy of
the bird. The pulmonary artery, as in man, takes dark
blood to the lungs to exchange its carbon dioxide for
oxygen. Of two animals of the same weight, which expends
more energy, the one that flies, or the one that runs
the same distance? Does a bird require more oxygen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>or less, in proportion to its weight, than an animal that
lives on the ground? Are the vocal chords of a bird

<p class='c011'><b>Economic Importance of Birds.</b>—Farmers find their
most valuable allies in the class <i>aves</i>, as birds are the deadliest
enemies of insects and gnawing animals. To the innumerable
robbers which devastate our fields and gardens,
nature opposes the army of birds. They are less numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>than insects and other
robbers, it is true, but
they are skilful and
zealous in pursuit, keen
of eye, quick, active,
and remarkably voracious.
The purely insectivorous
birds are
the most useful, but the
omnivorous and graminivorous
birds do not
disdain insects. <i>The
perchers and the woodpeckers
should be protected
most carefully.</i>
The night birds of prey
(and those of the day to a less degree) are very destructive
to field mice, rabbits, and other
gnawing animals. Some ignorant
farmers complain continually
about the harm done by
birds. To destroy them is as
unwise as it would be to destroy
the skin which protects the human
body because it has a spot
upon it! It cannot be repeated
too plainly that to hunt useful
birds is a wrong and mischievous
act, and it is stupid and barbarous
to destroy their nests.</p>

hawks). Many birds of prey are classed thus by mistake.
Sparrow-hawks, for instance, do not eat birds except in
rare instances; they feed chiefly upon insects. A sparrow
hawk often keeps watch over a field where grasshoppers
are plentiful and destroys great numbers of them. When
a bird is killed because it is supposed to be injurious, the
crop should always be examined, and its contents will often
surprise those who are sure it is a harmful bird. The
writer once found two frogs, three grasshoppers, and five
beetles that had been swallowed by a “chicken hawk”
killed by an irate farmer, but no sign of birds having been
used for food. Fowls should not be raised in open places,
but among trees and bushes, where hawks cannot swoop.
Birds which live exclusively upon fish are, of course,
opposed to human interests. Pigeons are destructive to
grain; eagles feed chiefly upon other birds.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>English sparrow</b> is one bird of which no good word
may be said. Among birds, it holds the place held by rats
among beasts. It is crafty, quarrelsome, thieving, and a
nuisance. It was imported in 1852 to eat moths. The
results show how ignorant we are of animal life, and how
slow we should be to tamper with the arrangements of
nature. In Southern cities it produces five or six broods
each year with four to six young in each brood. (Notice
what it feeds its young.) It fights, competes with and
drives away our native useful birds. It also eats grain and
preys upon gardens. They have multiplied more in Australia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and in North America than in Europe, because they
left behind them their native enemies and their new enemies
(crows, jays, shrikes, etc.) have not yet developed, to
a sufficient extent, the habit of preying upon them. Nature
will, perhaps, after a long time, restore the equilibrium
destroyed by presumptuous man.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Protection of Birds.</b>—1. Leave as many trees and bushes
standing as possible. Plant trees, encourage bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Do not keep a cat. A mouse trap is more useful than
a cat. A tax should be imposed upon owners of cats.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. Make a bird house and place it on a pole; remove
bark from pole that cats may not climb it; or put a broad
band of tin around the pole.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. Scatter food in winter. In dry regions and in hot
weather keep a shallow tin vessel containing water on the
roof of an outhouse, or in an out-of-the-way place, for
shy birds.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Migration.</b>—Many birds, in fact most birds, migrate to
warmer climates to spend the winter. Naturalists were
once content to speak of the migration
of birds as a wonderful instinct,
and made no attempt
to explain it. As
birds have the warmest covering
of all animals, the winter migration
is not for the purpose
of escaping the cold; it
is probably to escape starvation,
because in cold countries food is largely hidden by
snow in winter. On the other hand, if the birds remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>in the warm countries in summer, the food found in northern
countries in summer would be unused, while they
would have to compete with the numerous tropical birds
for food, and they and their eggs would be in danger from
snakes, wild cats, and other beasts of prey so numerous in
warm climates. These are the best reasons so far given
for migration.</p>

taught by the old birds to the young ones; they go in
flocks to keep from losing the way (Fig. <a href='#fig_316'>316</a>); the oldest
and strongest birds guide the flocks (Fig. <a href='#fig_317'>317</a>). The birds
which lose their way are young ones of the last brood, or
mothers that turn aside to look for their strayed young.
The adult males seldom lose their way unless scattered
by a storm. Birds are sometimes caught in storms or
join flocks of another species and arrive in countries
unsuited for them, and perish. For example, a sea or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>marsh bird would die of hunger on arriving in a very dry
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>landmarks of the route</b> are mountains, rivers, valleys,
and coast lines. This knowledge is handed down from one
generation to another. It includes the location of certain
places on the route where food is plentiful and the birds
can rest in security. Siebohm and others have studied
the routes of migration in the Old
World. The route from
the nesting places in
northern Europe
to
Africa follows
the Rhine,
the Lake of Geneva,
the Rhone, whence some species
follow the Italian and others the Spanish
coast line to Africa. Birds choose the
lowest mountain passes. The Old World
martin travels every year from the North
Cape to the Cape of Good Hope and back again! Another
route has been traced from Egypt along the coast
of Asia Minor, the Black Sea and Ural Mts. to Siberia.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Adaptations for
Flying.</b>—Flight
is the most difficult
and energy-consuming
method
of  moving
found among animals,
and careful
adjustment is
necessary.  For
balancing, the
heaviest muscles
are placed at the
lower and central
portion of the body.
These are the flying
muscles, and in some
birds (humming birds)
they make half of the
entire weight. Teeth
are the densest of animal
structures; teeth
and the strong chewing
muscles required
would make the head
heavy and balancing
difficult; hence the chewing apparatus is
transferred to the heavy gizzard near the
centre of gravity of the body. The bird’s
neck is long and excels all other necks in
flexibility, but it is very slender (although
apparently heavy), being inclosed in a
loose, feathered skin. A cone is the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>shape to enable the body to penetrate the air, and a small
neck would destroy the conical form. The internal organs
are compactly arranged and rest in the cavity of the breast
bone. The bellowslike air sacs filled with warm air
lighten the bird’s weight. The bones are hollow and very
thin. The large tail quills are used by the bird only in
guiding its flight up and down, or balancing on a limb.
The feet also aid a
flying bird in balancing.
The wing
is so constructed as
to present to the
air a remarkably
large surface compared
with the
small bony support
in the wing skeleton.
Are tubes
ever resorted to by
human architects when lightness combined with strength
is desired? Which quills in the wing serve to lengthen
it? (Fig. <a href='#fig_296'>296</a>.) To broaden it? Is flight more difficult
for a bird or for a butterfly? Which of them do the flying
machines more closely resemble? Can any bird fly for a
long time without flapping its wings?</p>

<p class='c017'>The practical value of birds in controlling insect pests should
be more generally recognized. It may be an easy matter to
exterminate the birds in an orchard or grain field, but it is an
extremely difficult one to control the insect pests. It is certain,
too, that the value of our native sparrows as weed destroyers is
not appreciated. Weed seed forms an important item of the
winter food of many of these birds, and it is impossible to estimate
the immense numbers of noxious weeds which are thus annually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>destroyed. If crows or blackbirds are seen in numbers about
cornfields, or if woodpeckers are noticed at work in an orchard,
it is perhaps not surprising that they
are accused of doing harm. Careful investigation,
however, often shows that
they are actually destroying noxious insects;
and also that even those which
do harm at one season may compensate
for it by eating insect pests at another.
Insects are eaten at all times by the
majority of land birds. During the
breeding season most kinds subsist largely on this food, and rear
their young exclusively upon it.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Partridges.</b>—Speaking of 13 birds which he shot, Dr. Judd says:
These 13 had taken weed seed to the extent of 63 per cent of
their food. Thirty-eight per cent was ragweed, 2 per cent tick
trefoil, partridge pea, and locust seeds, and 23 per cent seeds of
miscellaneous weeds. About 14 per cent of the quail’s food for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the year consists of animal matter (insects and their allies).
Prominent among these are the Colorado potato beetle, the
striped squash beetle, the cottonboll-weevil, grasshoppers. As a
weed destroyer the quail has few, if any, superiors. Moreover,
its habits are such that it is almost constantly on the ground,
where it is brought in close contact with both weed seeds and
ground-living insects. It is a good ranger, and, if undisturbed, will
patrol every day all the fields in its vicinity as it searches for food.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Doves</b>.—The food of the dove consists of seeds of weeds,
together with some grain. The examination of the contents of
237 stomachs shows that over 99 per cent of the food consists
wholly of vegetable matter.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Cuckoos.</b>—An examination of the stomachs of 46 black-billed
cuckoos, taken during the summer months, showed the remains
of 906 caterpillars, 44 beetles, 96 grasshoppers, 100 sawflies, 30
stink bugs, and 15 spiders. Of the yellow-billed cuckoos, or
“rain-crow,” 109 stomachs collected from May to October, inclusive,
were examined. The contents consisted of 1,865 caterpillars,
93 beetles, 242 grasshoppers, 37 sawflies, 69 bugs, 6 flies,

<p class='c017'><b>Woodpeckers.</b>—Careful observers have noticed that, excepting
a single species, these birds rarely leave any conspicuous mark on
a healthy tree, except when it is affected by wood-boring larvæ,
which are accurately located, dislodged,
and devoured by the woodpecker.
Of the flickers’ or yellow-hammers’
stomachs examined, three
were completely filled with ants.
Two of the birds each
contained more than
3,000 ants, while the
third bird contained fully
5,000. These ants belong
to species which
live in the ground. It is
these insects for which
the flicker is reaching
when it runs about in the
grass. The yellow-bellied
woodpecker or sapsucker
(<i>Sphyrapicus varius</i>) was shown to be guilty of pecking holes in
the bark of various forest trees, and sometimes in that of apple
trees, and of drinking the
sap when the pits became
filled. It has been proved,
however, that besides taking
the sap the bird captures
large numbers of
insects which are attracted
by the sweet fluid, and
that these form a very
considerable portion of
its diet. The woodpeckers
seem the only agents
which can successfully
cope with certain insect enemies of the forests, and, to some
extent, with those of fruit trees also. For this reason, if for no
other, they should be protected in every possible way.</p>

high in air in the afternoon or early evening. It nests upon rocks or
bare knolls and flat city roofs. Its food consists of insects taken
on the wing; and so greedy is the bird that when food is plentiful,
it fills its stomach almost to bursting. Ants (except workers) have
wings and fly as they are preparing to propagate. In destroying
ants night hawks rank next to, or even with, the woodpeckers, the
acknowledged ant-eaters among birds.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Crow.</b>—That he does pull up sprouting corn, destroy chickens,
and rob the nests of small birds has been repeatedly proved. Nor
are these all of his sins. He is known to eat frogs, toads, salamanders,
and some small snakes, all
harmless creatures that do some good
by eating insects. Experience has
shown that they may be prevented
from pulling up young corn by tarring
the seed, which not only saves the
corn but forces them to turn their attention
to insects. May beetles, “dorbugs,”
or June bugs, and others of
the same family constitute the principal
food during spring and early summer,
and are fed to the young in
immense quantities.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Meadow Lark.</b>—Next to grasshoppers,
beetles make up the most important
item of the meadow lark’s food,
amounting to nearly 21 per cent.
May is the month when the dreaded
cut-worm begins its deadly career, and
then the lark does some of its best
work. Most of these caterpillars are
ground feeders, and are overlooked
by birds which habitually frequent
trees, but the meadow lark finds and
devours them by thousands.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Sparrows.</b>—Examination of many stomachs shows that in
winter the tree sparrow feeds entirely upon seeds of weeds.
Probably each bird consumes about one fourth of an ounce a
day. Farther south the tree sparrow is replaced in winter by the
white-throated sparrow, the white-crowned sparrow, the fox sparrow,
the song sparrow, the field sparrow, and several others; so
that all over the land a vast number of these seed eaters are at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>work during the colder months reducing next year’s crop of worse
than useless plants.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Robin.</b>—An examination of 500 stomachs shows that over
42 per cent of its food is animal matter, principally insects,
while the remainder is made up largely of small fruits or
berries. Vegetable food forms nearly 58 per cent of the stomach
contents, over 47 per cent being wild fruits, and only a
little more than 4 per cent being possibly cultivated varieties.
Cultivated fruit amounting to about 25 per cent was found
in the stomachs in June and July, but only a trifle in August.
Wild fruit, on the contrary, is eaten in every
month, and constitutes during half the year a
staple food.</p>

<p class='c017'><b>Questions.</b>—Which of these birds are common
in your neighbourhood? Which of them
according to the foregoing report are plainly injurious?
Clearly beneficial? Doubtful? Which
are great destroyers
of weed seeds?
Wood-borers? Ants?
Grain? Why is the
destruction of an ant
by a night hawk of
greater benefit than
the destruction of an
ant by a woodpecker?
Name the only woodpecker

<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Suggestions.</span>—A tame rabbit, a house cat, or a pet squirrel may
be taken to the school and observed by the class. Domestic animals
may be observed at home and on the street. A study of the
teeth will give a key to the life of the animal, and the teacher
should collect a few mammalian skulls as opportunities offer. The
pupils should be required to identify them by means of the chart
of skulls (p. <a href='#Page_194'>194</a>). If some enthusiastic students fond of anatomy
should dissect small mammals, the specimens should be killed with
chloroform, and the directions for dissection usual in laboratory
works on this subject may be followed. There is a brief guide on
page <a href='#Page_223'>223</a>. The following outline for the study of a live mammal
will apply almost as well to the rabbit or the squirrel as to the cat.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The Cat.</b>—The house cat (<i>Felis domestica</i>) is probably
descended from the Nubian cat (<i>Felis maniculata</i>, Fig. <a href='#fig_333'>333</a>)
found in Africa. The wild species is about half as large
again as the domestic cat, grayish brown with darker
stripes; the tail has dark rings. The lynx, or wild cat
of America (<i>Lynx rufus</i>), is quite different. Compare the
figures (<a href='#fig_333'>333</a>, <a href='#fig_335'>335</a>) and state three obvious differences.
To which American species is the house cat closer akin,
the lynx (Fig. <a href='#fig_335'>335</a>) or the ocelot (Fig. <a href='#fig_334'>334</a>)? The domestic
cat is found among all nations of the world. What is
concluded, as to its nearest relatives, from the fact that the
Indians had no cats when America was discovered? It
was considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians, and after
death its body was embalmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <b>body of the cat</b> is very flexible. It may be divided
into five regions, head, neck, trunk, tail, and limbs. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>eyes have the same parts as the eyes of other mammals.
Which part of its eye is most peculiar? (Fig. <a href='#fig_333'>333</a>.) What
part is lacking that is present in birds? How are the eyes
especially adapted for seeing at night? Does the pupil in
the light extend up or down or across the iris? Does it
ever become round?</p>

<p class='c011'>What is the shape and the position of the <i>ears</i>? Are they
large or small compared with those of most mammals?
They are fitted best for catching sound from what direction?
What is thus indicated in regard to the cat’s habits?
(Compare with ears of rabbit.) Touch the <i>whiskers</i> of the
cat. What result? Was it voluntary or involuntary motion?
Are the <i>nostrils</i> relatively large or small compared
with those of a cow? Of man?</p>

<p class='c011'>Is the <i>neck</i> long or short? Animals that have long fore
legs usually have what kind of neck? Those with short
legs? Why? How many <i>toes</i> on a fore foot? Hind foot?
Why is this arrangement better than the reverse? Some
mammals are sole walkers (<i>plantigrade</i>), some are toe
walkers (<i>digitigrade</i>). To which kind does the cat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>belong? Does it walk on the ends of the toes? Does it
walk with all the joints of the toes on the ground? Where
is the <i>heel</i> of the cat? (Fig. <a href='#fig_334'>334</a>.) The <i>wrist</i>? To make
sure of the location of the wrist, begin above: find the shoulder
blade, the upper arm (one or two bones?), the lower
arm (one or two bones?), the wrist, the palm, and the
fingers (Fig. <a href='#fig_337'>337</a>). Is the heel bone prominent or small?</p>

<p class='c011'>In what direction does the <i>knee</i> of the cat point? The
heel? The elbow? The wrist? Compare the front and
the hind <i>leg</i> in length; straightness; heaviness; number and
position of toes; sharpness of the <i>claws</i>. What makes the
<i>dog’s claws</i> duller than a cat’s? What differences in habit
go with this? Judging from the toe that has become useless
on the fore foot of the cat, which toe is lacking in the
hind foot? Is it the cat’s thumb or little finger that does
not touch the ground? (Fig. <a href='#fig_337'>337</a>.) Locate on your own
hand the parts corresponding to the pads on the forefoot
of a cat. Of what use are soft pads on a cat’s foot?</p>

<p class='c011'>Some animals have short, soft <b>fur</b> and long, coarse over
hair. Does the cat have both? Is the cat’s fur soft or
coarse? Does the fur have a colour near the skin different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>from that at the tip? Why is hair better suited as a covering
for the cat than feathers would be? Scales? Where
are long, stiff bristles found on the cat? Their length
suggests that they would be of what use to a cat in going
through narrow places? Why is it necessary for a cat to
be noiseless in its movements?</p>

Name a jumping insect that has long hind legs; an amphibian;
several mammals (Figs. <a href='#fig_362'>362</a>, <a href='#fig_374'>374</a>). Does a cat
ever trot? Gallop? Does a cat chase its prey? When
does the cat move with its heel on the ground? The
claws of a cat are withdrawn by means of a tendon (see
Fig. <a href='#fig_338'>338</a>). Does a cat seize its prey with its mouth or with
its feet.?</p>

<p class='c011'>How does a cat make the purring sound? (Do the lips
move? The sides?) How does a cat drink? Do a cat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and dog drink exactly the same way? Is the cat’s tongue

<p class='c011'><b>The Skeleton</b> (Fig. <a href='#fig_337'>337</a>).—Compare the <i>spinal column</i>

a fish, a snake, and a bird.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>The <i>skull</i> is joined to the spinal column by two knobs
(or <i>condyls</i>), which fit into sockets in the first vertebra.
Compare the jaws with those of a bird and a reptile.
There is a prominent ridge in the temple to which the
powerful chewing muscles are attached. There is also a
ridge at the back of the head where the muscles which
support the head are attached (Fig. <a href='#fig_348'>348</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Count the <i>ribs</i>. Are there more or fewer than in man?
The breastbone is in a number of parts, joined, like the
vertebræ, by cartilages. Compare it with a bird’s sternum;
why the difference? The shoulder girdle, by which
the front legs are attached to the
trunk, is hardly to be called a girdle,
as the collar bones (clavicles)
are rudimentary. (They often escape
notice during dissection, being
hidden by muscles.) The shoulder
blades, the other bones of this girdle,
are large, but relatively not so
broad toward the dorsal edge as
human shoulder blades. The clavicles
are tiny because they are useless. Why does the cat
not need as movable a shoulder as a man? The pelvic, or
hip girdle, to which the hind legs are attached, is a rigid
girdle, completed above by the spinal column, to which it
is immovably joined. Thus the powerful hind legs are
joined to the most rigid portion of the trunk.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Mammals.</b>—The cat belongs to the <i>class Mammalia</i> or
mammals. The characteristics of the class are that the
young are not hatched from eggs, but <i>are born alive, and
nourished with milk</i> (hence have lips), and the <i>skin is
covered with hair</i>. The milk glands are situated ventrally.
The position of the class in the animal kingdom was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>shown when the cow was classified (p. <a href='#Page_9'>9</a>). Their care for
the young, their intelligence, and their ability to survive
when in competition with other animals, causes the mammals
to be considered the highest class in the animal
kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to these tests, what class of vertebrates should
<i>rank next to mammals</i>? Compare the heart, the lungs,
the blood, and the parental devotion of these two highest
classes of animals.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>The first mammals</b>, which were somewhat like small
opossums, appeared millions of years ago, when the world
was inhabited by giant reptiles. These reptiles occupied
the water, the land, and the air, and their great strength
and ferocity would have prevented the mammals from
multiplying (for at first they were small and weak), but
the mammals carried their young in a pouch until able to
care for themselves, while the reptiles laid eggs and left
them uncared for. The first mammals used reptilian eggs
for food, though they could not contend with the great
reptiles. Because birds and mammals are better parents
than reptiles, they have conquered the earth, and the reptiles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>have been forced into subordination, and have become
smaller and timid.</p>

<p class='c011'><b>Teeth and toes</b> are
the basis for subdividing
the class mammalia into
orders. Although the
breathing, the circulation,
and the internal organs
and processes are
similar in all mammals,
the external organs vary
greatly because of
the varying environments
of different species. The internal structure
enables us to place animals together which are essentially
alike; <i>e.g.</i> the whale and man are both mammals, since
they resemble in breathing, circulation, and multiplication
of young. The external organs guide us in separating the
class into orders. The teeth vary according to the food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>eaten. The feet vary according to use in obtaining food
or escaping from enemies. This will explain the difference
in the length of legs of lion
and horse, and of the forms of
the teeth in cat and cow. Make
a careful study of the teeth and
the limbs as shown in the figures
and in all specimens accessible.
Write out the dental formulas as
indicated at the top of page <a href='#Page_194'>194</a>. The numerals above the
line show the number of upper teeth, those below the line
show the number of lower teeth, in one half of the jaw.
They are designated as follows: <i>I</i>, incisors; <i>C</i>, canine;
<i>M</i>, molars. Multiplying by two gives the total number.

<p class='c011'>The <b>lowest order of mammals</b> contains only two species,
the duckbill and the porcupine ant-eater, both living in
the Australian region.
Do you judge
that the <i>duckbill</i>
of Tasmania (Fig.
<a href='#fig_359'>359</a>) lives chiefly in
water or on land?
Why? Is it probably
active or slow in movement? It dabbles in mud and
slime for worms and mussels, etc. How is it fitted for
doing this? Which
feet are markedly
webbed? How far
does the web extend?
The web can be
folded back when not
in use. It lays two
eggs in a nest of
grass at the end of a
burrow. Trace resemblances

between this
animal and birds.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The <i>porcupine ant-eater</i>
has numerous
quill-like spines (Fig.
<a href='#fig_360'>360</a>) interspersed with
its hairs. (Use?) Describe
its claws. It
has a long prehensile
tongue. It rolls into a ball when attacked. Compare its
jaws with a bird’s bill. It lays one egg, which is carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>in a fold of the skin until hatched. Since it is pouched
it could be classed with the pouched mammals (next order),
but it is egg-laying. Suppose the two animals in this
order did not nourish their young with milk after hatching,
would they most resemble mammals, birds, or reptiles?</p>

<p class='c011'>Write the name of this <i>order</i>. —— (See Table,
p. <a href='#Page_193'>193</a>.)  <i>Why</i> do you place them in this order (——)?
(See p. <a href='#Page_193'>193</a>.) The name of the order comes from two Greek
words meaning “one opening,” because the ducts from
the bladder and egg glands unite with the large intestine
and form a cloaca. What other classes of vertebrates
are similar in this?</p>

South America, thus indicating that a bridge of land once
connected the two regions. The <i>opossum</i> is the only
species which has penetrated to North America (Fig. <a href='#fig_361'>361</a>).
Are its jaws slender or short? What kinship is thus suggested?
As shown by its grinning, its lips are not well developed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Does this mean a low or a well-developed mammal?
Where does it have a thumb? (Fig. <a href='#fig_361'>361</a>.) Does
the thumb have a nail? Is the tail hairy or bare? Why?
Do you think it prefers the ground or the trees? State
two reasons for your answer. It hides in a cave or bank
or hollow tree all day, and seeks food at night. Can it run
fast on the ground? It feigns death when captured,
and watches for a
chance for stealthy
escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>kangaroo</i>
(Fig. <a href='#fig_362'>362</a>), like the
opossum, gives
birth to imperfectly
developed young.
(Kinship with what
classes is thus indicated?)
After
birth, the young
(about three fourths
of an inch long)
are carried in a ventral pouch and suckled for seven or
eight months. They begin to reach down and nibble grass
before leaving the pouch. Compare fore legs with hind
legs, front half of body with hind half. Describe tail.
What is it used for when kangaroo is at rest? In jumping,
would it be useful for propelling and also for balancing
the body? Describe hind and fore feet. <i>Order</i> ——.

<p class='c011'><b>Imperfectly Toothed Mammals.</b>—These animals live

Its movements are remarkably slow, and a vegetable growth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>resembling moss often gives its hair a green colour. (What
advantage?) How many toes has it? How are its nails

What is probably
the use of
the enormous
bushy tail? The
nine-banded armadillo (Fig. <a href='#fig_365'>365</a>) lives in Mexico and Texas.
It is omnivorous. To escape its enemies, it burrows into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the ground with surprising rapidity. If unable to escape
when pursued, its hard, stout tail and head are turned
under to protect
the lower side of
the body where
there are no scales.
The three-banded
species (Fig. <a href='#fig_366'>366</a>)

Compare the ears

teeth of insect eaters, even the molars (Fig. <a href='#fig_368'>368</a>), have
many sharp tubercles, or points, for holding insects and
piercing the crusty outer skeleton and reducing it to bits.
As most insects dig in the ground or fly in the air, we
are not surprised to learn that some insect-eating mammals
(the bats) fly and others (the moles) burrow. Are
the members of this order friends or competitors of man?</p>

Compare the shape of the body of a mole and a rat.
What difference? Why? Compare the front and the hind
legs of a mole. Why are the hind legs so small and
weak? Bearing in mind that the body must be arranged
for digging and using narrow tunnels, study the skeleton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>(Fig. <a href='#fig_368'>368</a>) in respect to the following: Bones of arm
(length and shape), fingers, claws, shoulder bones, breastbone
(why with ridge like a bird?), vertebræ (why are the
first two so large?), skull (shape). There are no eye
sockets, but there is a snout gristle; for the long, sensitive
snout must serve in place of the small and almost useless
eyes hidden deep in the fur. Is the fur sleek or rough?
Why? Close or thin? It serves to keep the mole clean.
The muscles of neck, breast, and shoulders are very
strong. Why? The mole eats earthworms as well as
insects. It injures plants by breaking and drying out
their roots. Experiments show that the Western mole will
eat moist grain, though it prefers insects. If a mole is
caught, repeat the experiment, making a careful record of

<p class='c011'><b>The Gnawing Mammals.</b>—These animals form the most
numerous order of mammals. They <i>lack canine</i> teeth. Inference?
The incisors are four in number in all species
except the rabbits, which have six (see Fig. <a href='#fig_345'>345</a>). They
are readily recognized by their <i>large incisors</i>. These teeth
grow throughout life, and if they are not constantly worn
away by gnawing upon hard food, they become inconveniently
long, and may prevent closing of the mouth and
cause starvation. The hard enamel is all on the front surface,
the dentine in the rear being softer; hence the incisors
sharpen themselves by use to a chisel-like edge.
The molars are set close together and have their upper
surfaces level with each other. The ridges on them run
crosswise so as to form a continuous filelike surface for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>reducing the food still finer after it has been gnawed off
(Fig. <a href='#fig_345'>345</a>). The lower jaw fits into grooves in place of
sockets. This allows the jaw to work back and forth instead
of sidewise. The rabbits and some squirrels have a
hare lip; <i>i.e.</i> the upper lip is split. What advantage is
this in eating? In England the species that burrow are
called rabbits; those that do not are called hares.</p>

English rabbits have increased

with by the loss of grass.

<p class='c011'><b>Ungulates</b>, as the horse, need no other protection than
their great speed, which is due to lengthening the bones of
the legs and rising
upon the very tip of
the largest toe, which,
to support the weight,
developed an enormous
toe-nail called a
hoof. The cattle, not
having developed such
speed as the horse,
usually have horns
for defence. If a calf
or cow bellows with distress, all the cattle in the neighbourhood
rush to the rescue. This unselfish instinct to
help others was an aid to the survival of wild cattle living
in regions infested with beasts of prey. Which of Æsop’s
fables is based upon this instinct? The habit of rapid
grazing and the correlated habit of chewing the cud were
also of great value, as it enabled cattle to obtain grass hurriedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and to retire to a safe place to chew it. Rudiments of
the upper incisors are present in the jaw of the calf, showing
the descent from animals which had a complete set of
teeth. The rudiments are absorbed and the upper jaw of
the cow lacks incisors entirely, as they would be useless
because of the cow’s habit of seizing the grass with her
rough tongue
and cutting it
with the lower
incisors as the
head is jerked
forward. This
is a more rapid
way of eating
than by biting.
Which leaves
the grass shorter
after grazing, a cow or a horse? Why? Grass is very
slow of digestion, and the ungulates have an alimentary
canal twenty to thirty times the length of the body.
Thorough chewing is necessary for such coarse food, and
the ungulates which chew the cud (ruminants) are able,
by leisurely and thorough chewing, to make the best use
of the woody fibre (cellulose) which is the chief substance
in their food.</p>

being moistened, portions of it pass successively into the

ground by the large molars as the animal lies with eyes

<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>a second time and is acted upon in the third division

dangerous weapons. The swine are the only ungulates
that are not strictly vegetable feeders. The habit of fattening
in summer was useful to wild hogs, since snow hid
most of their food in winter. The habit has been preserved
under domestication. Are the small toes of the
hog useless? Are the “dew claws” of cattle useless?
Will they probably become larger or smaller? <i>Order?</i></p>

of this order are the <i>lemurs</i> of the old world. Because of
their hands and feet being true grasping organs, they are
placed among the primates, notwithstanding the long
muzzle and expressionless,
foxlike face.
(Fig. <a href='#fig_402'>402</a>.) Next in

<p class='c011'>The <i>primates of the
New World</i> are all
monkeys with long
tails and broad noses.
They are found from
Paraguay to Mexico.
The <i>monkeys and
apes of the Old World</i>
have a <i>thin partition</i>
between the nostrils,
and are thus distinguished
from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>monkeys of the New World, which have a <i>thicker partition</i>
and have a broader nose. (Figs. <a href='#fig_403'>403</a>, <a href='#fig_404'>404</a>.) The
monkeys of America all have <i>six molar teeth</i> in each half
jaw (Fig. <a href='#fig_352'>352</a>); the monkeys and apes of the Old World
have thirty-two teeth, which agree both in number and
arrangement with those of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Which of the primates figured in this book appear to
have the arm longer than the leg? Which have the
eyes directed forward instead of
sideways, as with cats or dogs?</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly all the primates are
<i>forest dwellers</i>, and inhabit warm
countries, where the boughs of
trees are never covered with ice
or snow. Their <i>ability in climbing</i>
serves greatly to protect
them from beasts of prey.
Many apes and monkeys are
able to assume the upright position
in walking, but they touch
the ground with their knuckles
every few steps to aid in preserving the balance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>Simians</i> are the highest family of primates below
man, and include the gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and gibbon.
Some of the simians weave together branches in the
treetops to form a rude nest, and all are very affectionate
and devoted to their young. How are apes most readily
distinguished from monkeys? (Figs. <a href='#fig_401'>401</a>, <a href='#fig_406'>406</a>.)</p>

The widely differing environments under various forms of domestication cause “sports” which breeders are quick to take advantage of when wishing to develop new varieties. Professor De Vries by cultivating American evening primroses in Europe has shown that a sudden change of environment may cause not only varieties but new species to arise.</p>
